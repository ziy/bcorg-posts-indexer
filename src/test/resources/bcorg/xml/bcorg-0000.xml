		<Title>Great Quotes by Great Ladies</Title>
		<Content>Very cute, I also like the quote from Rosanne Barr, &quot;If I come home at the end of the day and my husband and kids are still alive, then I&#39;ve done my job.&quot;
Also Winston Churchill&#39;s quote, &quot;When you&#39;re going through hell, keep going.&quot;

		<Content>*Martha&#39;s Way*

Stuff a miniature marshmallow in the bottom of a sugar cone to prevent ice cream drips.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Just suck the ice cream out of the bottom of the cone, for Pete&#39;s sake! You are probably lying on the couch with your feet up eating it, anyway!

*Martha&#39;s Way*

To keep potatoes from budding, place an apple in the bag with the potatoes.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Buy Hungry Jack mashed potato mix, keep it in the pantry for up to a year.

*Martha&#39;s Way*

When a cake recipe calls for flouring the baking pan, use a bit of the dry cake mix instead and there won&#39;t be any white mess on the outside of the cake.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Go to the bakery! They&#39;ll even decorate it for you.

*Martha&#39;s Way*

If you accidentally oversalt a dish while it&#39;s still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant &quot;fix-me-up.&quot;

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

If you oversalt a dish while you are cooking, that&#39;s too bad. Please recite with me the real woman&#39;s motto: &quot;I made it and you will eat it and I don&#39;t care how bad it tastes!&quot;

*Martha&#39;s Way*

Wrap celery in aluminum foil when putting in the refrigerator and it will keep for weeks.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Celery?    Never heard of it!

*Martha&#39;s Way*

Brush some beaten egg white over pie crust before baking to yield a beautiful glossy finish.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

The Mrs. Smith frozen pie directions do not include brushing egg whites over the crust so I don&#39;t.

*Martha&#39;s Way*

Cure for headaches: take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Take a lime, mix it with tequila, chill and drink!

*Martha&#39;s Way*

If you have a problem opening jars, try using latex dishwashing gloves. They give a non-slip grip that makes opening jars easy.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Go ask that very cute neighbor if he can open it for you.

*Martha&#39;s Way*

Don&#39;t throw out all that leftover wine. Freeze into ice cubes for future use in casseroles and sauces.

*Maxine&#39;s Way *

Leftover wine?????????</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Hi my name is Carrie.

I was originally dx in 1999 shortly after my second daughter was born with stage 2, 3 pos nodes, er+. I was just 30 years old at the time. I had the usual... AC, taxol, rads, then tamoxifin.

Tamoxifin failed me miserably. I had pain walking in the fall of 2002 which turned out to be mets to the pelvis and spine. I had rads, zoladex, arimidex, and zometa. Tumor markers and PET scans have declared me to have no active cancer to date. I am so very grateful for that

.

In the spring of 2004, Zoladex was not as effective. I started menstrual cycles again. I had a complete hysterectomy including ovaries.

I have been in remission from stage IV for 3 years and BC a total of 6 years.  I am absolutely fine No Evidence of Disease!!!!!</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Hi Anna from Sweden, I have stage 3 BC cancer that started in 2000, 15 nodes affected but didn&#39;t spread else where one breast taken off.  I had 6 months chemo, stem cell transplant, and 30 days of  radiation.  My cancer came back in April of 2008, I think due to depression, and not eating right.  It came back as stage IV in my pelvis, 7cm, liver 2/2 cm tumors, and 13 cm on my oviars,and they cannot tell if  the fluid in my right lung is cancer.  I had my overies out and tubs. They said get my life in order. I ordered some Poly MVA and started taking 8 teaspoons a day since May, 08, along with eissac tea, and colloidal silver, a quart a day, and ordered a rife machine that I&#39;ve havn&#39;t started yet looking for a amp.Well five weeks ago they said my makers drooped from 200 to 116, that was 5 weeks ago I&#39;m scheduled to have blood work again. My doctor wants me to stop the poly to see if Femara is the one that&#39;s working but I&#39;m not going to do this.  I hate the drug Femara because I have thinning of the hair, and trying to fine a estrogen blocker thats natural to stop tumor growth. I know there are cures around the corner here in the USA like the IT101 trails in Ca, and nanobots, but these are going to take either 3/5, or 7 years more testing to be done. I&#39;m scared of chemo and ct scans because it makes cancer come back and you become more resistance to treatment with drugs like these later. I&#39;m fighting this the best way in knowledge of alternative medicine in diet, get juicing fresh organic vegetables and fruits a day to help.  Good luck with everything, I starting my survivorship I guess but wanted to let you know I have similar symptoms.</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Jacquilyn, I saw your post.  Thanks for sharing your story of courage and hope.  Just hand in there, please, I saw your note about cures around the corner in the US and them taking 3-7 years to come out.  Remember, if something is found to work amazingly well, they may fasttrack it and send it right out of trial into the real world.  Hang in. You must be doing something right to get your tumor markers down.  I am thinking of you. Maryiz</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Thanks for telling your story.  It gives me hope.  I have recently been diagnosed with stage IV Cancer - a big surprise, as just last February I was diagnosed with stage I BC.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation and thought I was cured.  I was taking Femara as adjuvant therapy.  On a fluke when I needed a CT scan for another reason, they found cancer in my bones.  I have no pain and it was such a shock to me.  My oncologist looked at a CT scan that I had last January before I was diagnosed with BC and he said he could see it in my bones by looking at that scan.  So it was actually in my bones before I was diagnosed with BC.  I have been distraught these last couple of weeks.  I am now on Zometa in addition to Femara.  I did have the flu like (really achy)symptoms with my first dose of Zometa and ran a fever, which I&#39;m just now getting over.  I&#39;ll be dreading my next dose.</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Dear Carrie,
 I am so happy for you!  It gives me hope!  I am also Stage IV w/ mets to C-T-L-Sacral spines, shoulder, ribs, and hips.  Also to lungs.  My prognosis is poor- 2 yrs  (that was 2 years ago).  I am curious of other stories of this type of metastis and survival.   Have you changed your diet at all?  How are you?  I, myself, have been limping around due to bone and nerve damage, but just got back from San Miguel de Allende w/ some girl friends and I did lots-O- shopping/ walking!  We just can&#39;t let it stop us!
 Sincerely,
 Rebecca (Rainbolt)</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Dear Curls,
 I too have stage IV BC.  I was diagnosed intially w/ BC in 1999 had Surgery, chemo and XRT followed by Tamoxifen.  Like a dummy, I quit taking the Femara because it was so expensive and I thought I had it licked.  Well, it came back in 2006  as mets to my bones and lungs.  Yikes!  One MD gave me a 2 yr guestimate and I&#39;m still here.  I have tried hormonal tx - 1 worked for awhile.  Then Abraxane which worked for awhile, then I tried Xeloda which didn&#39;t work at all for me, now I&#39;m on Gemzar and my numbers keep climbing.  It&#39;s funny how some Rx&#39;s work for some, but not others.  I have certainly learned that you can&#39;t compare individuals.  We are all so different.  So don&#39;t get into that way of thinking. Even my reaction to chemo and radiation the first time around was nothing compared to the 2nd time around (&#39;99 vs &#39;06).  Everybody and each time will/can be different.  I&#39;ve heard lots of good stories out there.  Keep me posted if you hear of any great stage IV stories.  I wish the best for you.  Rebecca</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Ten years ago I was diagnosed with Stage II Breast Cancer. I went through 4 treatments of Chemo and 25 radiation treatments. I had surgery...pleaded with the doctor to take both breasts, but they would not do it. At the ripe old age (ha) of 41 I was once again diagnosed with BC on the other breast with bone mets. I knew in my heart before I was diagnosed that it was in my bones. The pain was unbelievable, but nobody ever knew. I was told by my doctor that he would try to make what time I had left as easy for me as he could. I looked him straight in the eye and said &amp;quot;it&#39;s you, me and God in this..lets just see what happens. Almost 2 years later, still taking chemo and feeling good. (My doctor is in complete shock...I like that) The cancer is almost completely gone. I had it in the base of my skull, collar bones, breast bone, ribs, spine and hips. It is as if God put his hand on my head and it is going away, first in the base of my skull, then collar bones and so on. If you didn&#39;t know me you would have NO idea that I&#39;m having treatments. I wore scarves for a long time, but a bunch of girlfriends went wig shopping for the fun it. I got one that is so unlike me, but have found out I can have fun with that. My 12 year old son didn&#39;t like it at first, but now he loves it. The only reason I wanted to share is I know that there are other Stage IV women/men out there that would like to see just one person surviving. I don&#39;t read much on the internet...I just read the bible when it comes to cancer and know God is in full control. None of us know how much time we have, but we should enjoy each and every minute we can. I truly believe I will beat this. Don&#39;t let yourself get down or depressed. Stay strong...I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t have a down day or 2, but God will always pick me back up. Keep Fighting...I pray that I will be a Grandmother someday and the Lord Willing...I will. I&#39;ve been blessed with this disease.I know that sounds totally insane. I&#39;ve been asked if I could choose to have it or not, I would probably choose to have it. It has made me a better person and I have found out just how much faith I have. Please don&#39;t take me wrong...I really really don&#39;t want to die, not yet. I have so much to live for and you know what I don&#39;t like the treatments, but I have been blessed with a lot of new people/friends in my life. Don&#39;t feel like your alone...I&#39;m fighting this battle with you. May God Bless you......&amp;quot;Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Do not have fear of bad news, your heart is steadfast trusting in the Lord&amp;quot;</Content>

		<Content>Rebecca..Thank you for your story. As i said in my story...i just don&#39;t do these, but for some reason I was reading tonight. your story made my heart smile....Keep Fighting .. I like you, have found we are all so different on how we react to the treatments, so that is why I didn&#39;t say to much about that. I do know one thing we all have in common and thats our &amp;quot;will&amp;quot; to fight. I&#39;m proud to be in that group with you and everyone else.</Content>

		<Content>Kim
 Thank you so much for your uplifting post.  I was just diagnosed 2 weeks ago with stage 4 BC with mets to my liver.  I just want to find one doctor who will look at me with hope in their eyes.  I have been told about the max 5 year survival rate.  I have a two month old and a 3 year old, I have to survive this.  Reading all these posts gives me hope.  I am flying to NY (sloan kettering memorial hospital) next week for a second opinion.  Keep on posting ladies, I need it!</Content>

		<Content>They told me 16 months 3 years ago and I am now NED! Get a second opinion. I was fortunate enough to get in with Dr Gabriella D&#39;Andrea at Sloan-Kettering. They just have a different outlook on stg4 up there. I feel like I will live to be a crochetty old lady at this point! BTW my mets were in my liver</Content>

		<Content>Suspott:  I noticed on one of you other posts that you are from VA?  If so, what area?  I live in Va Beach.  I was interested in your post since I am a liver metsister too.  Can you share a little more of your history?  If you do live in Va, do you see a local onc and get supporting care at Sloan or is Sloan your primary care?
 Thanks for sharing...Darlene</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Hi everyone,
                thought id just say thankyou to all these ladies who have shared their stories, without it ladies like myself would at some point think their was no hope left.
 I first found my breats cancer november 10 2007,but was diagnosed in feb 2008,had lumpectomey,an node removal from arm pit,had 14 out of 16 positive nodes,an uneven margins ,so they needed to do mastectomy,they decided to give me chemo first ,i found more lumps develope in my breast while i had chemo which i was told was highly unlikely.
 Told oncologist i felt if they left my breast there any longer id die so please take it now,when they took it, i was right 2 other lumps had developed so i was reisstant to fec the chemo drug,an docitaxil,made me incredibly sick,so i had to stop it on second bout.
  When they looked at my breast they found out i was not growth 2 but 3,with high grade dcis,while all this went on it spread to my colar bone nodes,they sent me for radio therapy on the whole area the cancer had been an now these new nodes, i was told it was highly unlikely id get through it as i had so many nodes positive, but in december 2008 i was told i was unoffically free of cancer.
 Its now been just over a year an i have had some odd an very unpleasant symptoms happening, gp thought it was nothing ,then 2 lumps appear in my neck,i knew then without anyone telling me it was back,i had had a clear bone scan a few months before an have now had a clear ct from the neck down, due my head scan results soon.
 I was told about on the 19 feb 2010 my cancer was now secondary an in my neck,its growing at some amazing rate,which is scaring the life outa me, i keep pushing them to take my ovaries,or at least give me zolodex,but Im being made to wait an try Xeloda,with herceptin as im her2 positive,but what really got me me is how long it takes them to get you into treatment,al the time i wait i watch my body get worse an worse.
 I have lost all movment in the left side of my neck,im in accute pain constantly from my left shoulder blade to middle of spine an all way up to my neck,it has stopped me doing the simplest of things,but luckily one gp came to my rescue, im now on 60 mg of morphine twice daily,along with oramorph every 4 hours,i wish i didnt have to take such things but i just cannot function with out it.
 Im a mother of four kids all under 10,an all i ask for is another 15 years,let me bring my kids up,then who ever it is up there that decides can have me,just not yet please.
 All these stories have given me hope even if i can feel my body getting worse,as soon as my treatment starts hopefully i shall be as lucky as the ladies here.
 God bless you all,all my best Jervinia.x</Content>

		<Content>Hi Carrie,
Thanks for sharing your survivor bio.  I am also stage IV since 2001.  I had one year NED before it was back, but am stable right now.  Your success gives me hope that I&#39;ll get back there again.

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Feb 2005 was the month that my life changed forever and the lives of my loved ones and friends. Had severe pain in lower back and hips. Went to doc who ordered a bone scan and it was at this time that he found that I had Stage IV breast cancer to bone mets. The scan found the metastases in the bones and other tests determined it to be breast cancer although I have had mammagrams every year for the past 30 years and no history of cancer in my side of the family. We started with Zometa, femARA, and radiation for the bone pain. The bone scan done this Feb 2006 showed that the cancer had not spread to any new places and that there was evidence of healing in the lower spine where the heaviest concentration of mets was. I give praise and glory to God for this finding. All my family and friends have prayed for me during this time and God has heard these prayers. I do, however, have my days when anything little thing different going on in my body- a headache, new ache in my joints, a muscle that doesn&#39;t feel right, or just a bad feeling that I can&#39;t really pinpoint, can put me back in that valley of fear and worry. I have to keep focusing on the good news that I received and pray that what my doctors choose to do for my treatment was exactly the right thing for me at that time. Right now, we are treating my cancer as a chronic condition. The only thing that has changed is that I do Zometa every 6 weeks now rather than every 4. My tumor markers and alkaline phosphates are within normal range and I have lab work done monthly to monitor these.
Everyone&#39;s story is important and needs to be told. You never know who it might help. I was so encouraged just now to read of someone who has been Stage 4 for 3 years and still living life to the fullest. Thanks to everyone who offers their story. We have to pull hope out of each one&#39;s walk along this bumpy path called cancer.</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>It&#39;s hard to tell when to call yourself a Stage 4 survivor.  I was NED for almost three years after dx in early 2004 (mets to the lungs).  I went on Femara and Zolodex and my cancer quickly succombed.  However, since October 2006, the cancer is growing... but ever so slowly.  I went off the Femara and am participating in a clinical trial where everyone gets Faslodex and the test group also gets Lapatinib.  I do not know whether I am getting the &quot;real thing&quot; or not as my symptoms do not match the norm for lapatinib (diarrhrea and rash).  I am hoping to either be stable by my next scan in July or that some of the tumors have shrunk.  So, am I still a survivor?  I am completely asymptomatic and suffered no side effects from the Femara and now none from Foslodex.  Anyone else out there participating in this trial?  As with the rest of you who visit this site, every time I hear a success story, I feel as though it is my success, too.  Please everyone, if you know a good survivor story, pass it on!!</Content>

		<Content>Hi girls, I just thought that I would share a story...When I was dx a IIIc, I was crushed, but my aunt came to my rescue. She was dx a stage 4 from the beginning....that was 17 years ago. She was 70 when dx,she had a radical mast, she is er and pr pos, her-, 6 pos nodes. Her cancer went to her bones. She has had bouts of it through out the years, she is currently ned. She is 87 years old and is still getting around, mind you, a little bit slower, but still getting around. She is my hero!!!</Content>

		<Content>This is just what I needed to read today!  Naomi, your grandma ROCKS!!!
 I was diagnosed with extensive bone mets at the same time as my breast cancer in Feb 2006. I was stable for about a year. I had a small progression (still in my bones) found in February 2007 scans that was treated with radiation. I had a scan in July that *might* show progression, but they aren&#39;t sure because they LOST all my previous films!
  I am nowhere NEAR quitting and hope to be around for years to come. I want to be one of those stories that helps others keep on fighting.
 (((HUGS))) to you all!

		<Content>Diane,
 Like you I am nowhere near quitting!!!! I am 44 years old with a beautiful 2 year old daughter.   I am currently fighting.....I did three months of Chemo and am now on Aromasin.   The chemo &amp;quot;resolved&amp;quot; the cancer in the lymphnodes...but I still have it in breast and lower spine.   Bone scan and markers did not show anything when I was originally dx.  So I have had 3 PET scans since dx to follow the treatments.   In the back of my mind I wonder if the PET scans are accurate???   My family and freinds are unbelievable and very supportive.  This is my first comment....

		<Content>I am a single 33 year old w/ 2 young boys. Dx 3/07 with a very aggressive inflammatory breast cancer and fought it for a year as well as getting a mastectomy and full hysterectomy. They told me I was done just to be rediagnosed in May 2008 that the cancer is in many lymph nodes throughout my body. My onc said there is nothing more they can do for me and put me on Femara to try and &amp;quot;keep it at bay&amp;quot; and the average survival would be approx 2 years.  I&#39;m a fighter and am not excepting 2 years.  I am looking for anyone who can offer any advice or help with my situation.  I&#39;m feeling quite desperate!</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>hi, my name is Carrie and this is my first visit,I&#39;m 38 and was diagnosed with stage 3 inflammatory breast cancer July 28 2007.I participated in a clinical trial that consisted of 6 rounds of combination chemo, double mastectomy, four more rounds of chem and then I had 32 radiation treatments with an additional five &amp;quot;boost&amp;quot; radiation treatments to the scar line and chestwall. During the radiation I also had a hysterectomy. My last radiation treatment was April 28th. I am currently taking Femara. I have read that Avastin was approved (June 2008) to use in conjunction with chemo for stage four and inflammatory breast cancer. Ask your doc about adding Avastin to your treatment plan.
 I also havr four children, the youngest is my son who is just 17 months old. I have had two PET/CTs since April and a chest xray. So far...so good. CEA tumor marker was low but the CA27 is still elevated to100. Probably something microscopic floating around in me...hopefully the Femara will keep it in tact.</Content>

		<Content>mx,
 i hav the same cancer as u and u need to get a second opinion. MD Anderson in Houston has the only IBC clinic in the world...they have clinical trials going on. Or call the Cancer Treatment Center of America. Thats where I go now. The doctors are compassionate and they combine traditional medical treatment with nutrition, naturapathy, mind-body-spirit. You should call them...I go to the center in Philadelphia. They even have a financial assistance program if you qualify...let me know if you want more info. Hope that helps !!! :)</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>I think you can say I am a stage IV survivor, I was first diagnosed 1990 with bc and 10 years later
 it was metastatic. Liver, lungs and bones. My right hip was the most affected area. I had chemo and radiation and it stopped the cancer. Now, 8 years later I&amp;acute;m still with you. For 7 years I have had zometa and tamoxifen and now arimidix. Last year I had a brain tuomur and hopefully I can survive that too after radiation. My doctor says it&amp;acute;s not commen to live so long with mets in the liver and no chemo. Now I need sugery for my broken hip but the doctors don&amp;acute;t know if its possible. Please tell me if you know anyone with the same problem. Thanks, Anna from Sweden</Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>Hi all,
 I&#39;ve posted this at other places on the forum, but think it&#39;s worthwhile repeating. Although he didn&#39;t have breast cancer, my father did have metastatic prostate cancer in 1980. He had extensive metastases to the bones -- if I remember correctly, he even had mets in his skull! He was treated with surgery and chemotherapy, and went into remission. He survived cancer-free for EIGHTEEN YEARS, and died at the age of 80 from kidney failure.
 Take heart, there is absolutely such a thing as long-term survival for stage IV cancer patients -- I have witnessed it myself.
 Hugs to all,
 Annie</Content>

		<Content>Thank you so much for the story!!  I was diagnosed with Stage 4 with mets to the illiac bone in May, 2008.  All I can think about is the survival rate being only 2-3 years for most people and only 16-20% for 5 years.  I really needed to hear your story.  Thank you!!

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>I was diagnosed Feb 2007 with Stage IV BC with extensive bone mets (pelvic, hip, femur, tibia, spine, skull) and had fractures and severe bone damage which left me unable to walk.  I was given Taxotere and Cytoxin until Sept and then put on Femara.  I have also been receiving Zometa monthly since Feb 2007.  I am now scheduled early Sept for a major operation (cementing a cage to my pelvis and cementing a rod in my femur) which, hopefully, will allow me to walk again and improve my &quot;quality of life&quot;.  I am hoping that soon I will be able to inspire others who may be in the same situation.  I am grateful to hear of so many with &quot;quantity of life&quot; stories.  Blessings to all. </Content>

		<Title>Stage IV Survivor</Title>
		<Content>My cousin has been diagnosed with Stage IV BC that has traveled to her back.  She knows that she has BC but does not know that it has spread.  She has three children and her twin sister has taken her and her 3 children in.  We were all very upset and thought this might be the end but your stories give us hope that she can get through this.  Any advice, prayers or anything that I could pass along would be trully beneficial.  Thank you and bless you all.</Content>

		<Content>That&#39;s a notice for anyone who prefers to NOT be exposed to this type thread. Turn back now, or forever hold your peace..

Ok, for those who are still with me, I felt I had to post this, in recognition and gratitude for what the Lord has done.

As many know, I went back to work Monday night. I was scared (mental deficits/fatigue/12+ hour shift at night). I talked to my Sunday School class about my fears, the bad week I had just finished, going back to work with suture in my chest, you name it, I moaned about it. They gathered around me, prayed that I&#39;d be able to do my job, calm my fears and be a blessing to those I encountered at work. God bless this group, they&#39;ve held me during this drama with bc.

Monday morning when I woke up, I could feel their prayers lifting me up, and such a peace inside. By the time I went to work Monday night, I was feeling like &quot;oh, it&#39;s just time for bed

&quot; One of the first patients I had was a black woman in her early 50&#39;s who had recently been diagnosed with liver cancer. She was passive, looking scared. I discovered she was to have a port placed pretty soon, and when I told her it was my first night back after 6 months of chemo, and had just had my port removed, she looked astounded. (didn&#39;t the bandanna on my head give it away??? doesn&#39;t coordinate well with the official purple scrubs). I asked her would she like to see where my port was? she said definitely. I knew the Lord had given her to me, for a reason. I showed her my port site, with suture still in, told her what a blessing it was, and tapped it a bit and said &quot;it&#39;s nothing at all really, that doesn&#39;t hurt when I do that&quot;... can you say LIAR? LOL She looked so relieved, and it felt sooooooo goooooood inside to know I made a difference in her life, gave her hope. This story has more chapters, but I gotta run out the door, my first rad treatment is this morning and I can&#39;t be late.

Yes, I&#39;m a procrastinator, and have an unhealthy obcession with this site (apparently).</Content>

		<Content>I just got off the phone with my step sister Debbie.  She is going through such a rough time.  She is also a BC survivor.  She was diagnosed in Nov. 04, just 2 months before me.  She dragged me through chemo.  I don&#39;t know if I could have made it without her support.  She has struggled with her health since dx and treatment.  Doctors have been filling her with steroids to combat her health issues.  Her children are off and on drug abusers and Debbie has always been the one to make sure the grandkids have clothes and school supplies, etc.  She can&#39;t do it all anymore.  Last month she ended up in a psychiatric hospital for a week. They said the steriods was part of the problem.  I can relate to how she feels.  I&#39;m not normal myself since my dx.  It&#39;s very hard for us to take care of ourselves.  How can we take care of others also?
Knowing that you need the Lord&#39;s help is a big part of the battle.  Tonite I&#39;m praying for all of us who are trying to take care of ourselves and our loved ones and especially my step sister Debbie.
God&#39;s peace and blessings to you all.
Susan</Content>

		<Content>For you Susan and your step-sister Debbie.  I&#39;m sorry she is going through such a rough time.  Sometimes it seems like we are given more on our plate than we can handle at one time and we reach a point of running on empty.  As you said, how can we help others when we are unable to help ourselves.  Praying that her children become more responsible and get their acts together for their own sakes and those of their children.</Content>

		<Content>Susan my heart felt prayers go up for all of you that have to battle the side effects of the treatment and worry, and the world does&#39;nt stop and cut you a break. My eyes fill with tears
when I read about this. God see&#39;s her struggle Susan, I know he is gently whispering to her heart to give it to Him , I think we all hold on to things sometimes that if we just surrender, He is there.
Love and prayers going up Susan for Debbie and her grandbabies and her children, and all of us that are holding on to things that we need to surrender.
Sometimes he calms the storm , sometimes he calms the child
(thankyou Wendy)
hugs,
Carrie</Content>

		<Content>Lord, I agree with these prayers.  You yourself have said that where two or three are gathered in Your name, there You will be in their midst (Matthew 8:20).  Thank you, Lord, for being with each of us here.  Thank you for going before us while we&#39;re in this storm (Deuteronomy 31:8) and thank you for never sleeping and always giving us comfort and rest just when we need it!
Daddy, we love you!
Always,
Wendy

		<Content>I just got this and had to share....
The Blind Horse
Just up the road from my home is a field, with two horses in it. From a distance, each looks like every other horse. But if you stop your car, or are walking by, you will notice something quite amazing. Looking into the eyes of one horse will disclose that he is blind. His owner has chosen not to have him put down, but has made a good home for him. This alone is amazing.
If nearby and listening, you will hear the sound of a bell. Looking around for the source of the sound, you will see that it comes from the smaller horse in the field.
Attached to her halter is a small bell. It lets her blind friend know where she is, so he can follow her. As you stand and watch these two friends, you&#39;ll see how she is always checking on him, and that he will listen for
her bell and then slowly walk to where she is, trusting that she will not lead him astray. When she returns to the shelter of the barn each evening, she stops occasionally and looks back, making sure her friend isn&#39;t too far
behind to hear the bell.
Like the owners of these two horses, God does not
throw us away just because we are not perfect or because we have problems or challenges. He watches over us and even brings others into our lives to help us when we are in need. Sometimes we are the blind horse being guided by the little ringing bell of those who God places in our lives. Other times we are the guide horse, helping others to see. Good friends are like this ~ you don&#39;t always see them, but you know they are always there. Please listen
for my bell, and I&#39;ll listen for yours...</Content>

		<Content>Kathy, you summed up what this thread is all about.  &quot;Our faith is part of who we are&quot;.  That being said, I think this is a beautiful thread (for the most part) and I see many women finding comfort and strength here.  Isn&#39;t that what these boards are for?  Thanks, Rachel, for starting this thread. Faith is what is helping me &quot;Move Beyond Cancer&quot;.

THANK YOU- I JUST FOUND THIS, AND THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE SEEN AGAIN! GODS SPEED TO ALL-debbyfive</Content>

		<Content>What do you say on those days when you are finding it hard to be positive and upbeat. I have been so depressed and tired and unhopeful.  I was reminded today that God is the only one I need to depend on.  The only one I can really depend on.  Sometimes it is hard to keep a hold of that thought.
Yes, I have started on new anti-depressants.  The old ones din&#39;t work very well.  The new ones don&#39;t seem to working at all.
I&#39;m so glad I have somewhere to go and cry.  You all are so sweet.  Thanks for listening.
God Bless,
Susan</Content>

		<Content>I think you count your blessings Susan, you say &quot;today I did the best that I could&quot; and you remind yourself that tomorrow is a new day, one with hope.
And yes, this is a place to come and cry when things seem so bleak.  I&#39;m sorry your new meds don&#39;t seem to be working.  I&#39;ll pray that you begin to find them helpful and if they aren&#39;t that your doctor will be able to give you something else to try that is the right fit.
There are some days that just defy description...don&#39;t hold on to those ones too tightly or you might miss the good ones when they float towards you...</Content>

		<Content>I have been recently diagnosed and am therefore very new to treatments, etc.  I have gone through the whole discussion board and have been reading posts from each section in order to learn more.   I was very greateful to find this section.  I believe with all my heart that God is ever present in our lives whatever the circumstances.  It seemed to me so much of the board was focused on the material means of threatment and not much was offered for those who feel that the addressing our spiritual needs is equally important.  Then I found this thread.  Thank you all.  Your stories have been inspiring and I will be visiting this thread as often as I can.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you very much for the welcome.  I am finding that I am coming to this site often to re-read the posts.  I was feeling quite strong about my dx until today, when everything just seemed to crash!  I suppose that is normal, but what scares me the most is while I am trying to know the truth about my real identity as a child of God who will love and protect me in all situations, I feel even my faith waivering.  I know that none of us are statistics and it does no good to focus on the worst possible outcomes.  I guess I have come to conclusion over the last few weeks that the medical treatments offered for this disease all basically a &quot;crap shoot&quot;...sometimes they work sometimes they don&#39;t.  While I trust my doctors as excellent practioners who are truely trying to do God&#39;s work, it is really only in God that we can trust as the only source of our well being.  Thank you all again, for this thread.  It helps a great deal.  My prays are will all of you!</Content>

Doris you bring up a great point, bluekitten went to meet God when her body failed her. Yet I know she knew this was her destiny.
In the meantime this is a great place to feel encouraged for those of us with earthly bodies.</Content>

God is so good - and it&#39;s such a good reminder from Phillipians that Christ came to cure our spirtual wounds, not necessarily our physical ones.  What a wonderful gift!

		<Content>I believe that Jesus Christ came to us as a demonstration of the healing activity of God.  God is Love, and is All. If we are the perfect image of God, then only God, Love is real and we cannot be separated from our true identity.  &quot;In God, we live and breath and have our being&quot;
God bless you all.</Content>

Love is patient,love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.
1 Corinthians 13:4-7

		<Content>Dear Wonderful Sisters,
First I have to simply say Thank You from the depths of my heart.  I was led to this thread without any doubt in my heart, because I truly needed to find where I belong.  I haven&#39;t visited this thread in a VERY long time.  I was one of the original posters when Rachel started the thread, I was uplifted then and because of many other things that were going on at that time on the boards, I strayed away from this thread.
I have felt so down and defeated  in my personal life, that I haven&#39;t visited the boards as often in the past few months.  When I did I would just pop in and out and move on.  I don&#39;t know why I had forgotten this thread, or I guess I should say why I had not realized it&#39;s rebirth.  I have been so down and out and finally fell on my knees crying out to God to hear me, and guide me.  I haven&#39;t been the Christian that I should have been recently, I have taken my burdens and continually piled them on my shoulders to the point that I was unable to see the light through all of the darkness.  I didn&#39;t turn my burdens over to the Lord like I know I should have,  He is strong, but I am weak.  I have been a Christian for over 30 years, and I know the Love and Blessings and Peace that come from our Father above.  I just lost my way for a while and felt as if I was drowning in sadness and helplessness.  Which is so out of character for me.  I have always been the &quot;strong&quot; one in my family.  The person everyone comes to with their problems.  I guess I&#39;ve always felt I had to live up to that, so instead of turning to anyone, not even God for help in my hour of need,  I tried to handle it all on my own.  I don&#39;t have to tell you wonderful sisters what a huge mistake that is......I have failed so miserably.  I have had so much bitterness and anger,  although I&#39;ve tried to hide it and hold it in, it was there.  I won&#39;t really get into the &quot;personal&quot; details now, but I&#39;ve been devasted and hurt so deeply by my dh throughout my bc journey that my bitterness and anger continued to grow,  I wasn&#39;t angry with God, I wasn&#39;t angry or bitter about my diagnosis, I was just devasted by the events that unfolded after my diagnosis.  The pain and hurt that was caused by my dh, eventually turned into bitterness and anger that completely took over my life.
When I felt that I had finally hit rock bottom, I cried out to God to forgive me and to guide me, and to please take these burdens away, take this bitterness and anger that had robbed me of the joys of my salvation for way too long.   And praise God he did,  he took my burdens away, and when I came to the boards a few days ago I was led directly to this thread.  I have been reading all of your wonderful uplifting, caring, loving posts and want you to know that I truly have found my place here.  God is so good all of the time, I know he led me here, to &quot;meet&quot; not only my bc sisters but my sisters in Christ and to join you all in holding each other up through the good times and the bad.
Sorry for this long post,  just writing this feels so good.  To finally know that I have found my way again,  thanks to my loving Father who is always there, he didn&#39;t leave me, I turned my back on him.  I am so thankful that he is a loving and forgiving God, that always welcomes us back when we have turned from him.  I just want you all to know that you are in my prayers and I would truly appreciate you all keeping me in your prayers as well.
Sherry,  I am praying for great results on your MUGA, and I&#39;m so sorry for the weekend wait to find out whatever your doctor called for.  I know that these people just don&#39;t understand the worry that they cause us, if they did, I&#39;m sure they would handle it differently.
Susan and Debbyfive, the scripture that you both quoted above is one of my favorite scriptures.  When my children were younger and they would get in a fuss or were irritable with each other, I would get the Bible and they would each have to read 1 Corinthians 13: 4-7.  Now that they are grown they still quote those verses.  Thank you for posting them, they brought a smile to my face.
May God richly bless you all!
Love,
JoJo</Content>

		<Content>JoJo,
Welcome back, dear sister!  I don&#39;t get on the boards as much as I used to either.  I have kids at home that both use the computer quite a bit, so my time is limited.  However, when I do come, I try to drop by this thread.  I love it!
Thanks for sharing your heart with us.  I hope you save a copy of your post.  You might want to read it or refer back to it from time to time.  I will include you in my prayers as well.
Sherry - keep us posted! I&#39;ll keep praying!
Girls - I have a song stuck in my mind (we sang it at church today), that I thought I&#39;d share with y&#39;all. (don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not going to sing it - lol) I remember singing it a year ago at church, shortly after my diagnosis and hardly even being able to get through it.  Today, I sang it with joy and peace, and got through it just fine.  It made me realize that I did have to &quot;surrender&quot; my life to Him, because I didn&#39;t know what the future held....but isn&#39;t it wonderful to know that He holds the future?

Jesus, All for Jesus

Jesus, all for Jesus
All I am and have and ever hope to be
Jesus, all for Jesus
All I am and have and ever hope to be
All of my ambitions, hopes, and plans
I surrender these into your hands
All of my ambitions, hopes, and plans
I surrender these into your hands
For it&#39;s only in Your will that I am free
For it&#39;s only in Your will that I am free

Jesus, all for Jesus
All I am and have and ever hope to be.

I really wish I could play it for you.  But I guess just the words will have to do for now.
Sweet dreams, sweet sisters!

		<Content>Carrie, Susan, Debby, JoJO and Wendy, thank you all for your prayers and your loving hearts.  I called my doctor&#39;s office first thing, spoke with a nurse and they had
ONLY
wanted to tell me that my thyroid is
&quot;normal&quot;.
Hallelujiah!!  My weekend was anything but normal.
I took everyone&#39;s advice and stopped worrying, because worry solves nothing and robs us of precious time.  And NS had her cat looking out for all the &quot;worries&quot; under my bed and in my closet
so I knew I was safe on that front.
But it was your prayers for me, to help me over these few days that carried me and helped to put the quiet in my heart and allowed me to just leave those worries with God so that I could enjoy the most of each day.  I spent yesterday planting two rose bushes, made a lovely meal for my family, spent some quiet time with my soul and my spirit, and had a wonderful conversation with my best friend.  Wednesday will be fine as well and I am optimistic that the muga (and all your prayers for this!) will have been fine and I will continue with my treatment.
I would like though to ask you for one more prayer.  I know a woman through my son&#39;s hockey.  She and I were never close.  She has always had an unpleasant personality ~ she was rough, she gossiped, she was very much into money, power and having the best, being the most noticed, speaking only with those she thought could do something for her, disdainful of anyone else.  I think we all know people like this ~ unhappy within themselves and looking to make others feel less or feel bad in order to make themselves feel better.  There is an emptiness and a void.  She and I did not always see eye-to-eye which made it hard ~ I managed the hockey team for the 3 years our sons played together.  Two years ago she was dignosed with cancer of the lungs.  She was treated and seemed to be doing well.  I had had minimal contact with her, but did speak often with her husband.  Apparently her personality did not &quot;change&quot; during this cancer journey which made me sad for her.  Shortly after I was dx&#39;d with bc, her cancer (sarcoma) returned. Her husband spoke with me often, about chemo, about treatment, about cancer, about life and asked advice on many occasions which I gladly gave.  I made peace with the past, I made peace with the person she had been, the hurt she had given me and gave that to the Lord to help me move forward.  I reached out to her, though I did not expect that she would reach back.  Cancer has a way of making us realize that we are all sisters and brothers, no matter what our personalities, or our differences.  But sadly, some people do not change.  She is, however, a mother who loves her husband and her sons and within that she does have redeaming qualities, as we all do.
I was talking to my best friend last night (who was our sons&#39; hockey coach) and I asked after her (he still golfs occasionally with her husband)..I knew from the husband that things were not good and she was going to NY for some treatments that are not available in Canada, but according to my friend, she is now at home, having hospice and has about one month left.  She has made her peace with this.  My heart goes out to her, to her family and to her children who are 14 and 17.  I&#39;m asking if you would join me and include her in your prayers for peace, comfort and a very safe journey.</Content>

		<Content>JoJo thanks for your post.  It is easy to take back our burdens.  It is easy to shut God out even when we know that doesn&#39;t work and are trying hard not to. It&#39;s easy to feel as if we are drowning in our depression. I have done that myself recently.  I went to see my Pastor today and had a long talk.  I am realizing how defeated I feel and somehow that helps me to look beyond it.  We prayed together and that helped.  He didn&#39;t throw me out of his office and that helped too.
Life sometimes isn&#39;t easy and faith won&#39;t always be easy.  So as Patti shared in the poem &quot;PUSH&quot;.  Pray until something happens.   I don&#39;t feel so defeated anymore.  I&#39;m grateful that I know the Lord.  It&#39;s nice to get to know you.
Welcome Home,
Susan</Content>

		<Content>Wanted to thank you all once again for your prayers and your positive thoughts.  I&#39;m never amazed by the power of prayer and how much lighter our load is when we have shared with others and ask to be blessed.
My muga results were slightly lower than last time, still within a &quot;good&quot; range, so I was allowed to have the infusion.  I&#39;ll be tested again in 2 months...results from these tests can fluctuate so I&#39;m not worrying and will just keep praying that the heart maintains its function as I go through this part of treatment.
I&#39;m blessed to know all of you and bless you all each and every day.</Content>

		<Content>The Deepest Worth
These are the things I prize
And hold of deepest worth:
Light of the sapphire skies,
Peace of the silent hills,
Shelter of forest, comfort of the grass,
Shadow of clouds that swiftly pass,
And after showers
The smell of flowers,
And of the good brown earth,
And best of all, along the way,
Frendship and mirth.
--Henry van Dyke</Content>

		<Content>This is the first time I have visited this particular board.  I tried posting this a few minutes ago but when I finished it would let it post - it&#39;s that we sometimes get.
There are two songs by Booklyn Tabernacle Choir that have really touched my heart.  One is &quot;My&quot; song because it says so much of what I feel.  I am going to try to see if I can get this to post this time, even if I have to try to copy it and post.  Perhaps you know the song also.  It is called:  He&#39;s Been Faithful
In my loneliness and fear, through every pain every tear
There&#39;s a God who&#39;s been faithful to me
When my strength was all gone, when my heart had no song
Still my God has been faithful to me
Every word He promised is true
What I thought was impossible
I&#39;ve seen my God do
He&#39;s been faithful, faithful to me
Just looking back His love and mercy I see
When in my heart I have questioned
And failed to believe
He&#39;s been faithful, faithful to me
When my heart looked away, the many times I could not pray
Even then He&#39;s been faithful to me
The days I&#39;ve spent so selfishly, reaching out for what pleased me
Still in love He&#39;s been faithful to me
And every time I come back to Him
I see Him waiting with His open arms and I know once again
He&#39;s been faithful, faithful to me
Just looking back His love and mercy I see
When in my heart I have questioned
And failed to believe
He&#39;s been faithful, faithful to me
For whatever reason God decided that I needed to climb the mountain that I had always prayed he would give me.  He and I started at the bottom and together we made the climb and stood on the mountain top.  God was everything he ever promised he would be - He&#39;s been Faithful to Me.
Blessings to all.  I hope you don&#39;t mind my sharing this song; it is one I could just stand, raise my hands, close my eyes and worship and considering I was raised Missouri Synod Lutheran(conserative)that says a lot.</Content>

God the Father, source of everything divine, you are good surpassing everything good and just surpassing everything just. In you is tranquility, as well as peace and harmony. Heal our divisions and restore us to the unity of love, which is similar to your divine nature. let the bond of love and the ties of divine affection make us one in the Spirit by your peace which renders everything peaceful. We ask this through the grace, mercy, and compassion of your only Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

		<Content>Hi Ladies,
Thank you Cowgirl for the kind words.  I hope that things are going well in your life.
Debby,  I&#39;m so glad that you are back,  I missed &quot;seeing&quot; you around.  It&#39;s always good to see your sweet words.
Susan,  that is so appropriate at this time.  I pray that all of our sister&#39;s will return to the site soon, and that healing will take place very soon.  It is heartbreaking that so many have left.  I truly miss Sherry, she has always been a ray of sunshine to this site.
Sherry, if you are reading this, please PM me and  let me know that you are okay.  I am worried about you.  I cannot imagine how anyone could say anything negative to you or about you.  You are always so uplifting.  I know that you must be very hurt to leave,  but I know that God can heal your broken heart.  I want you to know that I am here for you, and that I miss you, and that I am praying for you.
Love and Hugs,
JoJo</Content>

		<Content>What I&#39;m about to write is very personal.  I can&#39;t go into great detail because it is a very long story.  All my life I was very close to my father.  He passed away this passed July in the middle of my chemo.  He had always been there for me unconditionally no matter what and I could always depend on him!  I am the youngest of 4 children and my sister, the eldest always felt my father didn&#39;t love her like he did me and their was much resentment all thru our adult lives. She is 10 yrs older than me and had made it very difficult on me and my father especially.
To keep a long story short,  the past few yrs my mother had been fighting with uterian cancer and then it came back after 8 yrs.  My father had Parkinson&#39;s and this past year had CHF three times starting in 1/04 then again in 5/04 twice while I was going thru diagnosis and biopsy and mastectomy, and chemo.  I was the one who always went with them to all their appts. because they needed another pair of ears.  Also, my father was now on oxygen 24/7 and had to use a wheel chair to go anywhere.  I had no problem going with them and was glad I could.
When hospice came to help out with my father, I was no longer in any shape to help them with much of anything (always tired or going to another treatment)  My sister stepped in to help out at night and stay with my Dad just to help out my mother, not for him.
My father adored her but she could not see it no matter what.  Before he passed away,  she was now taking care of him for HIM.  She read to him from the Bible and prayed with him everynight.  She finally felt my father&#39;s love for her and finally developed the relationship with him that they both needed and I believe he definitely died in peace because of that.
I really feel that if I hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with BC I would have stood in the way of them ever reconciling because I was the one who was always there for him!
My sister and I are closer than we&#39;ve ever been now.  She tells me she finally knew the father I did and is so thankful for the two months she had with him.  She tells me too that she is so sorry I had to pay the price for her, but I think it was a small price to pay for them to both have peace of mind and find each other&#39;s love.
If my dx was the factor that helped them to find each other, I don&#39;t think can complain.

		<Content>Is this a board for moving beyond cancer or a Christian Witness board??? Have you ever considered the fact that you may be intruding your thoughts and beliefs on people who are not Christians?? Jews, muslims, athiests, etc get cancer,too.
This site is supposed to be about breast cancer
Just a thought.......</Content>

		<Content>Jilly,
I am glad to live in a country where we are free to express ourselves.  I would love to read a Jewish or Muslim thread on this board.  Please encourage anyone you know to start one.  Our faith is a part of who we are and part of coping with moving on with our lives.  All of us are so much more than just a breast cancer case, and that is the beauty of this site.  I&#39;ve read about struggles with marriages, pets, children, landlords - all on this site.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Jilly, I&#39;m sorry you feel that we are intruding our thoughts and beliefs on you. I titled the thread the way I did to keep anyone from reading it, without deliberately wanting to, by clicking on it, and scrolling down. I realize there are many other beliefs, and what other people believe is not a problem for me. If someone believes in Satanism, and starts a thread on that, I would have no reason to complain, especially if they made it clear that was the subject before I read the thread. I hate the anomosity that has started because of this thread. However, I cannot say I regret starting this thread. This country was founded on the  religious freedom, and the right of free speech. As you can see, many others have had very positive spiritual experiences to share, and it&#39;s what has kept us sane during bc. I see that you are new to these boards as of today in fact, how unfortunate that the first threads you found were ones that created anomosity. I think if you continue reading on, you will find lots of support and compassion on this site. It is a blessing to all of us, and I am sure you will be welcomed with open arms too.</Content>

If you really hated the animosity that was started you would have apologized to Denisa...because you are the one who attacked her.  Denisa&#39;s post to you was kind, respectful and informative...you chose to go after her as if she had personally threatened you.  Practice what you preach.
And feel free to go to the moderators...I have nothing to be concerned about.

That being said, I think this is a beautiful thread (for the most part) and I see many women finding comfort and strength here.  Isn&#39;t that what these boards are for?  Thanks, Rachel, for starting this thread. Faith is what is helping me &quot;Move Beyond Cancer&quot;.</Content>

		<Content>I have no problem with this thread and if someone wants to have a thread concerning how a different religion sustains them that would be fine because if they are so titled, we have the option of whether to read them or not.  I also think that when we have very strong opinions about something..it is easy to think someone is attacking us when perhaps they are not. Perhaps Denisa&#39;s comments were filled with foresight because she suspected complaints like Jilly&#39;s would be forthcoming and she wanted us to avoid the conflict. In any case, I hope we can all forgive and move on. And thank you for the wonderful and inspirational stories you have been sharing on this thread.

		<Content>Rachel did preface this thread to warn those who did not want to read about the topic.  There are many many threads on these forums that I do not want to read because I don&#39;t have interest in the topic.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t start to read them and then scold the people who were posting there because I didn&#39;t like the topic!
Rachel - maybe you should bold your preface to this forum so that it stands out more.</Content>

That&#39;s a notice for anyone who prefers to NOT be exposed to this type thread. Turn back now, or forever hold your peace..
In my humble opinion, anytime a post begins like this, the poster knows that what she is posting will stir up controversy. That is not what we come here for. There is a subject thread for religious/spiritual posts for a reason. Religion is a very sensetive subject, and while I understand that some of us take great comfort in these types of posts, there is an appropriate place for them. I think the poster knew that when she began this thread.......</Content>

		<Content>I failed to mention in my earlier post that I&#39;m the person Heidi shared a Bible verse that she had taken into surgery.   I wrote it on a piece of paper and had the nurse tuck it up under my cap before I went in.  She asked if she could read it and I said sure.  She teared up and then asked if she could pray for me.  It was still in my cap when I came out of recovery and got back to my room.  I have since shared it with a bc sister here on the boards and she did the same thing!  I think that is very cool.</Content>

		<Content>Jilly, the best I can say is that I truly believe Rachel meant no harm and was sincere in trying to let people know what the thread would be all about.
we&#39;ve been having discussions today about how things can be mistranslated from what we want them to be because people cannot see our body language or hear how we want the post to come out.
Why don&#39;t we just give her the benefit of the doubt and decide to read elsewhere if it makes us uncomfortable?  Again I won&#39;t bother reading threads that have no interest to me.  But I will defend their right to be here.

		<Content>Oh, I forgot another very wonderful experience I had during bc. I went to the hospital to get my bone scan. This is the same hospital where I had my son (now 11). At that time my mother was still alive, for some reason she was listed among my &quot;next of kin&quot; (I am still married to father of my son..happily so, but whatever...it was a mixup in their records). Anyway, the girl asked me whether this was correct in my records and I said, no, my mother died in 1998 (she was also tx at the same hospital, same oncologist as I have). The girl taking my information became very quiet when I told her of the fact that my mother and I shared an oncologist. She asked me if &quot;it ever became easier&quot; not having your mother. So, I asked her what was wrong and she started crying. She had lost her mother a couple of weeks before. The poor dear, it was one of her early days back and work and she was having a tough time w/ her grief. Of course, I tried to comfort her as best as I could and also shared that I knew that God loved her and I bet her mother was with the angels right now.
So the error in my record was there so this girl could get a bit of comfort that day.
What I&#39;ve found is that bc does help sensitize us more--even if we were before--to the sufferings of others. Remember the verse about how Christ looked with compassion on others? I think that is what we are called to do, be kind, try to understand, and try to hear what is in the voice or see what is in the glance.
Blessings to you all

		<Content>Rachel - you said at the top - don&#39;t come here if you don&#39;t want to. I think that&#39;s fair.
As a nurse you seem to have a lot of opportunities to be empathatic to your patients as a result of your cancer experience.  More than once I&#39;ve wondered if the staff caring for me had ever been in my place -- a patient dependent on medical staff.
For me this experience serves to make me a better wife. My husband has re-occurant lymphomia. My experience helps me to emphatize with his treatments (which are going well) and fears about them.
I don&#39;t think God sent cancer to me. In fact he put people in my life who have &#39;cured&#39; it. But I think I can learn from the experience, and that he wants me to.</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
To answer your question... I have a Palm 515... there are newer ones now and they have gotten cheaper. Epocrates is a site that has drug and diagnostic programs that will download to your PDA. Skyscape is another website offering many programs you can download. There are emergency medical ones but I can&#39;t see me in a code whipping out my Palm!
God has provided for my needs. An area of weakness in my faith has been when something ominous occurs and wondering if God can &quot;handle it&quot; without my help... duh... then I acknowledge that He made ME and He has loved me for 57 years... He can guide me through the muck!!!
I just want to comment on the concerns about the Christian testimony on this thread. The first job I had as a NP was for a Muslim physician. He was very faithful and knew that my faith was important to me. We had a mutual respect for each other and our different religious beliefs were not an issue. I met one of my best friends... the lab technician... when I worked for him. She remains a close friend today and we pray for one another and often share how God has moved in our lives. We will never accept each other&#39;s religious beliefs but there is an bond we have because we are both people of faith... though she goes to the mosque and I to my church. Being a Christian does not make one anti another religion. My grandfather was a Polish Jew and we all know what persecution they experienced. I think the key is love and respect for each other.
May you ALL be blessed,
Pat</Content>

		<Content>Rose, I have always liked caring for cancer patients, but ever since I started chemo, I have thought about making it my regular job. I watched the nurses doing the infusions , and watched the patients there for the chemo. I realized they have a unique relationship, and the patients form bonds with each other that are unbelievable. I&#39;ve watched veteran patients and their spouses help orientate the new ones, telling them all the little things that the nurses may not think of, offering prayer, supporting others when they may be living their last days on this earth. I guess it&#39;s  the selfless acts of very ill cancer patients that touched me the most. They make me want to be a better person, they inspire me, they make me ashamed of my complaining, whining, ingratitude for what I have, when I see their contentment with the little bit of time they have left. I would be so much richer (in my soul) just by being around them.</Content>

		<Content>Hi, Rachel.  Let me say it here.  &quot;Sadly, once again the MINORITY rules&quot;.  It&#39;s very odd the way things work out.  But you can bet it worked out just as the Lord intended!  And that should certainly be cause for pause.  I love your post and find them very positive and uplifting.  I applaud your courage in sharing your faith and being obedient to what God has commanded.  I&#39;m sure you will have many jewels in your crown!  I ask for your prayers as I get my last TAC tomorrow.</Content>

Today in church a women stood up and said I want to say Heidi is my hero. This women went for a biopsy on Thursday and it was benign.(how she got the results so fast????) But I talked to her the week before by chance and told her to just trust the Lord and she said she did.
Hang in there everyone!!! Heidi</Content>

I would like to think of this as Field of Dreams Rachel. God doesn&#39;t care what section he&#39;s put in....if you post it they (the poeople who need, want it) will come.

		<Content>Sherri, I hope your TAC went well today. Girl, you&#39;re a tough one, doing all 3 at once! You know, it&#39;s such a wonderful feeling to be done. Will you be doing rads?
I have to say thank you to everyone who supported the thread, and sent me those lovely PM&#39;s supporting this thread. I had never dreamed of feeling persecuted like this, and I cannot call it anything but persecution. The devil will use ANY thing or anybody to do his work. He uses my temper and big mouth to do it sometimes.
I see that the controversial threads were removed by Melissa today. And she had said she was going to place this up higher, but at the time of this typing it hasn&#39;t been moved. I like to think that this is bad that He is turning to good, and like G (no surrender) said, this is the field of dreams baby! I love that thought. We built it, and they will come. How cool is that? What an uplifting idea.
God is good all the time, and He prevails always. I am having a hard time posting anything like I started the thread for, but I wanted to check in with everyone. I love you all, and will try to have an upbeat post when I return. Take care, sisters.</Content>

		<Content>&amp;lt;font&gt; Rachel,
Let me start my saying you know I love ya, girl! And I love your posts....they are ALWAYS INSPIRATIONAL (whether you are talking about God or not)
I&#39;m not going to comment on where I THINK this thread belongs, because it&#39;s of no consequence now.
But what I want to relay is that this thread did start as an inspirational &quot;let&#39;s share how God has been a positive force in our lives&quot;, but SOMETIMES (and not for all posters) scriptures start getting quoted and cited. Quotes are being posted straight out of the bible.
There is a fine line here. If you want to share stories about how God has affected your life, that&#39;s one thing.
But some carry it further to almost a preaching level (just like teaching a Sunday School Class).
And here is where it makes it uncomfortable.
I believe in God. I want to know others believe in Him and how he works miracles in their lives. That makes Him more personal to me.
But I don&#39;t want to feel like I have to hear/read a sermon in order to know others&#39; beliefs. Just share, don&#39;t preach.
Again, Rachel, please don&#39;t stop coming to the boards.....you are a valued FRIEND here. By me especially.
Big Hugs! &amp;lt;!--color--&gt;</Content>

		<Content>I hope you will keep coming to the boards too, Rachel. Lately, when I think of Christianity, I have been thinking  of the holy spirit.  I have read that when the holy spirit comes to live in our hearts he/she/it feels sad when there is division and judgement.  We all screw up, yet we are loved anyway..especially if we sincerely repent.  Many of the &quot;God Breezes&quot; I have read here have been so uplifting.
Thank you so much,.

		<Content>Sherri and Heidi,
I hope your treatments went well.  Just think, in about3-4 weeks your taste buds will be back to normal, your gut won&#39;t be growling, and you will start to get hair again!  I couldn&#39;t wait to get a good ole greasy spoon cheeseburger with onion, mustard, pickles, tomato, and lettuce.  It tasted SO good.
We just got back from the Frio River at Concan.  When I checked the boards and saw the change, I thought to myself that this is probably good for me.  This is really moving away from the cancer and on with life.  As I scroll down to get to this thread, I will actually see more of this site.  I want to encourage newly diagnosed and those in treatment when it is appropriate, but I will come to this site!
God bless your day!

		<Content>God is the God of all comfort and we can comfort others with the comfort we have received from Him.  I just got off the phone with a friend who has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  She and I were really close when our kids were younger, then my family moved to another town and we have lost touch somewhat.  The bond of the Spirit is stronger than distance and she called me this morning after talking to a mutual friend who urged her to call.  She is dealing with the whole death and dying issue we all face with this disease.  We were able to encourage one another to live whatever amount of time we have on this earth to the glory of God.  When I get squeezed, I want the juice of the fruit of the Spirit to come out of me.  I want to praise God for He is good all the time!
God bless your day!

		<Content>Kathy, what a beautiful expression. If I could remember that more often, I would be a much better person. So many times I know I must make the Lord pretty sad from the bitter juice that flows from me, or when I am dried up and nothing flows at all. You have such a great outlook on life, and the best part is you&#39;re not afraid to give the credit where credit is due. We are blessed by your presence on this site.</Content>

		<Content>Hi, Rachel.  I&#39;m so glad you are back!  To you and Kathy I say thanks for the encouragement as I &quot;recover&quot; from that last tx.  I will be moving onto rads soon.  Please keep me in your prayers as I continue to move through this journey.  And please know that I am in prayer for both of you every day.  Kathy, I have added Jan to my prayer list as well.</Content>

		<Content>Well, here&#39;s my post of an amazing event at work Tuesday morning.  I hope it&#39;s as inspirational and uplifting  for you as it was for me.
My unit is in 2 sections, with a short hall between. Around 3am Tuesday morning I heard the operator call a code blue on the other side of my unit. We don&#39;t have many codes, we tend to get patients with that severity to the ICU/CCU fast. This code was on a frail, elderly lady who had experienced an arrest in response to a fairly harmless anti-nausea drug. Her nurse had seen her awake  minutes before finding her dead.  The code team arrived shortly, and took over CPR on the lady. After  going thru the ACLS protocols, doing all that dramatic stuff you see on tv, she had no response to anything they had done. The ER doctor asked some of the crew from the ER &quot;is she the lady from room X in the ER?&quot; and they said &quot;yes&quot;. He had taken care of her in the ER, saying how devastated the family would be, a very doting family. This patient came in with abdominal pain and now she was dead.
You know how sometimes you say those little prayers to God in your mind? I found myself thinking of that family and saying &quot;please Lord let her be okay&quot;.  The doctor pronounced her dead at 3:35am, after I said the prayer. I have strong feelings about dead bodies, in my heart I know they can hear us during/after dieing. When the doctor gave the go ahead to get her cleaned up, tubes removed etc. I volunteered to help the tech do it.  I can&#39;t explain why that was important to me, I just wanted it done with dignity. So, the tech and I were putting on our gloves to do post mortum care when the doctor looked at the screen on the crash cart and said &quot;her heart has started beating again&quot; and he felt her carotid artery and he could feel the heart beating too! Can you imagine the shock of this happening minutes after she was pronounced dead? I was standing there, I saw them do chest compressions, put an ET tube and bag her, give the drugs  to restart her heart, and they did this for over 30 minutes. They stopped at  given intervals, checking for spontaneous heart beat, breathing..anything that would indicate they were  successful. I saw this woman was dead, there was no doubt. So, they  rushed her to ICU. Luckily, we hadn&#39;t started removing tubes . How amazing is that???
And, just to make this clear, this story isn&#39;t about ME saying a prayer. It isn&#39;t about me at all, it&#39;s just that I was one of the people who witnessed this miracle. I hesitated to tell the part where I was praying for her, because I don&#39;t want to give the impression it is about me at all. Simply put, the Lord hears our prayers and can take bad situations and turn them to good. Like NPat says, He is the great physician.
The next day after getting some sleep, this is the conclusion I drew from this experience. In the long run, the efforts of man are inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. No matter how much we try, we can&#39;t prolong life. I took comfort from the fact that by all appearances (of all the medical personnel and medical equipment) this woman was dead. If the efforts of the medical staff had been successful this would have been attributed to man. The sequence of events made it clear, to me, that God has the final word on this Earth.  I take this as a ray of hope for all bc survivors. I&#39;ve done all I can to prevent recurrence.  In the end, whether I&#39;m stage 0 or stage 4, no statistic will lengthen nor shorten my life. God has a perfect plan for me, whether I agree or understand it, it&#39;s still perfect.</Content>

I have faith in my friend Gina and complete utter faith in my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  We have fear and doubt all around us. but with our Savior&#39;s help, we have created a place for support and love.  Thank you Lord for providing for us. Guide our steps.</Content>

		<Content>Amen Susan ! I was shaken by G&#39;s news,
but not because I ever thought she could not fight the beast again and win. I am so mad that she has to
do it again !!
It makes me mad whenever I read anyone is battling this wretched beast.
Father I join Susan in lifting G and asking for your protection as she faces her surgery this coming week,
and all the ladies that are struggling with treatments
and facing surgery. Cover them Lord.
Please God we need a cure.Amen</Content>

I had chemo prior to the surgery and they could not find any signs of the tumor in the breast, looking at the lymph nodes.  Thanks for your prayers.  The surgery went really well and I was well cared for.  That&#39;s one thing I have learned through this -- there are a lot of good, caring people out there.</Content>

		<Content>In praise and thanksgiving for a good pathology report - negative nodes.  Good and loving Father, you hear our voice and answer our cries.  Thank you for your grace to endure these trials.  Thank you for your love which is beyond measure.  Thank you for your forgiveness and mercy.  Help us to be more compassionate as a result of what we have gone through.  Grant that we may reach out to others in their time of need and console them.  Watch over us and guide us in our paths that we may return to you who made us.  Amen</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
Sorry.  I was going to give my opinion on that, and see that I never did.  Thing is, I don&#39;t know.  I have a brother-in-law who is a heart surgeon.  He is a very busy person, and we hardly ever do talk to him, but the next time I talk to him I should ask him about this for you.  We probably will be talking to him in the next week or so.
About the test, you know, I think I would do it. But, we are all so different.  I&#39;m into tests these days.  Just had the ultrasound of my uterus, ovaries, and now tomorrow going for colonoscopy.  I want them all to be good and free of cancer, and hope they will be, and will feel so good to know that.  I have this wrap around my arm now, and it is DRIVING ME CRAZY!!!!  And, I can&#39;t eat all day.  I&#39;d edgy!  Have a headache, haven&#39;t had one of those in a long time.  What can I do about all of this?  Yeah, well, I know, and I will, give it to the Lord.  Drink lots of water, read my bible, and talk to God about it all.
Good to be like minded with you all.

		<Content>Just finished my &quot;temple molding&quot; (exercise). I have gotten back in the habit so I actually look forward to it and it isn&#39;t such a chore. This has been a good week. Able to &quot;stoke the spiritual coals&quot; of a few patients. So many times when we meet adversity... the question is &quot;Why, God?&quot; But God has often been left out of the mix until the crisis has occurred. He loves us and wants a RELATIONSHIP. My husband&#39;s favorite gospel song is Dottie Peeples...&quot;He&#39;s an On-time God&quot;...&quot;He&#39;s not there when yah want Him. He&#39;s there when yah need Him. He&#39;s right on time!&quot; He is ALWAYS there because we always need Him but we use Him like an &quot;on-call God&quot;. This whole BC adventure has certainly reinforced the desire God has for open communication with us. I got the book, &quot;Give Me 40 Days for Healing&quot; by Freeda Bowers when I started chemo... it is a 40 day prayer journal and very powerful. I have recommended it to several patients and fellow church members. Freeda (a pastor&#39;s wife) prefaces the book with her own need for healing through prayer during a tough time in her life. Each day has a lesson and prayer focus. The reader then reflects on the lesson and applied it to his/her own situation through journalling. I have been able to read back over last year and see how God has brought me through each day and I have become so much more aware of His love for me. I have shared with each of my physicians that I pray for them daily. One has told me how much that means to him... the others have been silent but that is OK. We are the messenger, not the Savior. Sisters, to those we encounter, we are a visible manifestation of God&#39;s love when we testify about how He continues to bring us through our trials... even if we are bald, chunky and, like me, have LE garments. The curiosity is there, &quot;How can you praise God when you have had breast cancer?&quot; For me that is a door wide open and I have no trouble sharing the provisions given me because I am His.
Sisters, may your joyous hearts doeth good like a medicine!!!

		<Content>HEIDI,
I FOUND THIS ON THE WEB:
The Red Sea Rules - Review
The Red Sea Rules by Robert J. Morgan
I found this book sitting in the basket of books in the bathroom. So it started off as a &quot;bathroom book&quot; but it eventually made its way to my book bag, and then onto the side of this blog. I think its short, easy to read chapters drew me in. Here is my review of this book:
Summary: The Red Sea Rules is a short study on the situation that the Israelites found themselves in on the shores of the Red Sea. It uses this story and the lessons to apply them to today&#39;s situations. All of us find ourselves in tough situations from time to time.
The book, which is full of great quotes and some excellent short story illustrations begins with this quote from C.H. Mackintosh:
The sea was before them, Pharaoh&#39;s hosts behind them, and the mountains around them. And all this, be it observed, permitted and ordered of God.
Ultimately, we all need to recognize this truth. God is and always will be in control of the situation. And His purposes are good.
Here are the rules that are outlined in the book:
Rule 1 - Realize that God means you to be where you are.
Rule 2 - Be more concerned for God&#39;s glory than for your relief.
Rule 3 - Acknowledge your enemy, but keep your eyes on the Lord.
Rule 4 - Pray!
Rule 5 - Stay calm and confident, and give God time to work.
Rule 6 - When unsure, just take the next logical step by faith.
Rule 7 - Envision God&#39;s enveloping presence.
Rule 8 - Trust God to deliver in His own unique way.
Rule 9 - View your current crisis as a faith builder for the future.
Rule 10 - Don&#39;t forget to praise Him.
My Thoughts: I thought this book was a great read. As I mentioned before, the short chapters made this book easy to read, but those short chapters were full of really good content.
I always love books that are full of quotes. The work of this author compiling the wisdom of several other authors is both enlightening and enjoyable.
Sometimes when books like this are written, I feel like they are trying to pull a point out of thin air. But I didn&#39;t feel that way about this book. The Bible tells us that the things that happened to those people in the Old Testament, happened as an example for us. Sometimes the example is what to do, sometimes it is what not to do. But ultimately, these things happen as an example of who God is, and how He works with us.
TO ALL YOU GALS:
I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET A COPY OF THIS BOOK AND READ IT.  I JUST CHECKED ON E-BAY, AND THERE ARE LOTS OF COPIES OF THIS BOOK, REAL CHEAP.  I&#39;M GETTING MY COPY TODAY!  LOOKS LIKE A VERY, VERY GOOD BOOK!

		<Content>Caroltina, I am gonna go look for this book right now on Amazon, I love that site. That sounds like a great book, and reading your words right now, feel like they were meant for me. I have a co-worker, Pam who does housekeeping in our unit, that may have lost her job due to harassment, and unjustified claims by  a secretary in our unit, who is known for being mean and ugly to people. Pam has 3 small kids, and just so happens that Tuesday night, she shared a little with me, and told me she had prayed for her job, the Lord had given it to her, and the devil wasn&#39;t gonna ruin her, or make her retailiate, she was set on doing the right thing, and ignoring the crap basically. Well, on Wedneday, she was suspended...and probably will be fired Monday if it didn&#39;t occur Friday. Everyone is in shock, we had no idea what was being done or said against her, she doesn&#39;t gossip or complain.  I believe God sent her to talk to me Tuesday night, so I&#39;d be aware of what was going on. Otherwise, nobody would have known, secrets @ work, nobody allowed to tell anything when someone is fired, etc. So, anyways, I am real upset for her, and the sad thing is, we don&#39;t know her phone number or how to contact her. It&#39;s against policy to give an employees number out. So, several of us got together and wrote our feelings down, and this will be presented to her main boss Monday. As it turned out, the boss that is 4 levels up from her immediate boss was there last night, isn&#39;t God good??? And of course, he was glad I talked to him, and told him how upset we were, that Pam was nothing but excellent in her work. I have been her supervisor, as the co-ordinator of my unit for 9 months before being off with bc. All of us have written up a complaint that she has been dismissed, and we have emphasized that she is nothing but excellent, quietly goes about her job, anticipates what you need done, you NEVER have to ask her! So, I guess upper management may not be real happy with us, but that&#39;s what we did, and I want you all to please pray for her to get her job back. I think the devil is testing her faith. How ironic, that it happened the very next night. She told me &quot;Rachel, sometimes how you react to something is more important than anything you can say to them. Your actions speak louder than words.&quot; I know we were meant to have this conversation, the Lord was wrapped up in all of it. Sadly,she&#39;s not in the phone book. I don&#39;t know what church she goes to, so I sent word by her co-workers in housekeeping that if anyone knows her phone number, please call her and tell her we are trying to get her job back. I also made copies of all of the wonderful things we wrote about her, so that the evidence won&#39;t &quot;disappear&quot;. It&#39;s not the first time that someone has been falsely accused of something by ONE person, and got fired, without a proper investigation. I am so proud of one of my coworkers, she is so red neck, like me...LOL but so much braver. She actually spit it out, and told the truth on the matter. The woman who caused Pam to lose her job is racist, and hates Pam cuz she is black. (all of us are white that wrote the letters). So, thanks for listening, please pray for Pam, that God will bless her with peace, and to keep the faith. She is being tested, but I know her faith is strong.</Content>

		<Content>There, I bought the book, for $5, including postage.  Got it used on e-bay.
About your co-worker - yes, it is against policy and probably the law to give out phone numbers of employees.  I think it is o.k., though, if they specifically give you permission to do so.  So, they could give your phone number to her, and she could call you back.  Do you think they anyone there, who is in a position to do so, would do that for you?
btw - I didn&#39;t write that review, I just copied it off the internet, from what someone else wrote who had read the book.

		<Content>Caroltina-wow our diagnosis is close. I had bilateral surgery, grade 3 tumor, 3 nodes+ ER+70% and her2neu+++.
Thank you so much for posting that about the Red Sea Rules. I read a chapter when I feel that &quot;scared of the unknown&quot; feeling creep in. It is more like a guide for me.
Rachel-that is some story. You are such a good person thinking of others.
I hope you all have a good weekend. Heidi</Content>

		<Content>Caroltina! what a fantastic idea! someone could give my phone number to her, someone in authority that cares, like Pams bosses. You are a thinker, I would have never thought of it! I don&#39;t think the chemo did any damage to your brain cells. Although I can&#39;t brag too much on my own brain power.
Thanks for the thoughts. God bless you all.</Content>

		<Content>Roxwoood,
Thanks for the comliment.
Had a good morning this morning.  I had a little sore throat and just didn&#39;t feel very chipper, so was going to stay home from church.  Instead I got up and went, and when I got there, the Sunday School teacher wasn&#39;t going to be there and they needed someone to teach the kids.  So, I volunteered, as I&#39;m planning to take over that responsibility the end of July, anyway.  So, there were extra kids there today, and I was totally unprepared, but I did it.  I loved it, and did a good job teaching, and the kids connected with me, knew that I loved them, that Jesus loves them, and that there is hope for each and every one of their lives.  I was so adrenalized after class!  I really love teaching kids.  They are so fun!  Just think, I almost missed out.  God was so good to give me that opportunity, and to help me know what to teach them.

		<Content>I am asking for prayer from all the sisters!  God placed a burden on my heart for having a prayer/fasting retreat with a few women.  I received this impression from God as I sat in church on 5/29.  We have been talking about revival and going past our comfort zones in ministry in our Sunday school class for the last few weeks.  Our church leaders have a vision for evangelizing the neighborhood where the church is located.  It has the highest crime rate in our city.  Several have gotten involved with the elementary school that is a couple of blocks away and the church officially sponsors the school.  I felt the Lord telling me that I needed to get a small group of women together and pray and fast.  I talked with my friend who has a ranch house that could sleep 10 women (more on the floor).  She is a long time friend and a member of the same church.  We were in a Mom&#39;s In Touch group together several years ago, but we currently are not in a prayer group.  She was excited and felt that this was confirmation of her prayers.  We planned it for this weekend 6/10-11; getting started Fri. at 5:00p and ending at 5:00p on Sat.  We just got together to plan and pray.  While we were talking we realized that the enemy is throwing spears our way.  We need prayer covering for this.  God has placed it on my heart to pray for our marriages, our families, drug abuse, pornography, sexual perversion, gay marriage, teen pregnancy and promiscuity, the media, local, state, national, and international leaders, missionaries, terrorism, the persecuted church, our church leaders, as well as giving thanks and praise to our Almighty God.  Thank you in advance for your prayers.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Kathy,
I will stand with you and pray for a covering for your ladies. In the name of Jesus, the enemy wil have no part in any disruption of the gathering. I speak peace to the event and that the Holy Spirit be released to dwell and empower those in attendance. May you receive wisdom in planning whatever outreach you are prompted to pursue and may the hearts of those to whom you minister be receptive to the Gospel.

		<Content>Just on here quickly to say my friend kept her job, she didn&#39;t get fired! And God certainly is good, she was as struck by the completely obvious hand of God in the timing of the whole thing. It really is phenonomal! She was pretty shocked at what had occured while she was off, pending investigation, but she was also so touched, we hugged and hugged last night, and she got big tears in her eyes cuz we cared so much. God certainly is faithful, and good. I am so thankful for your prayers and so is my friend. She was falsely accused of not doing her job by 2 miserable, bitter women, a secretary and a RN charge nurse. God gave her 4 people to contradict the lies of 2, and how specific is this??? He worked it so that 2 RN charge nurses gave a supportive statement vs 1 false one, 1 HUC and 1 staff RN who wrote supportive statements vs the 1 HUC who filed false ones. God is good, he doubled what she needed to keep her job, He put us all there on that specific night, the very people (rebels
)  who would risk the comfort of the jobs to support her!  We were brought together on the very last night before she would have been fired! Isn&#39;t His timing wonderful?? It reminds me of Joseph, how he went thru it all with such graciousness and God so richly rewarded him. Our employer is kinda giving us a hard time for &quot;discussing confidential information&quot; (right, nobody knows so nobody can defend you) and implying we could be terminated for that... well, the same God that protected Pam (my friend) will also protect us too. Can you tell how joyous I am?? It&#39;s such an example to all who knows Pam, and the circumstance what a wonderful Lord we have. Well, going to Orlando for a week, may not be back til next Friday, please keep us in prayer for a safe journey. I will lift each of you up as well. Each of you have a ministry, and Kathy, your prayer group may have some snags to wade thru in the beginning, but it will only be sweeter when it comes to fruition.  Thanks for listening.</Content>

		<Content>When I first learned about my cancer, I wondered how I would make it through this.  Knew God would be with me but our Pastor was diagnoised with Cancer earlier this year; has it in the liver, around the stomach, some in the lungs; they thought it started with colon cancer but not sure.  Anyway, his struggle is way worse than what I&#39;m heading into, so shyed away from calling upon him.
Then something told me to contact him; sent him an email about needing his guidance and wisdom.  We have since prayed.  He was in church last Sunday and the whole church gathered around us, covering us in prayer.  It was the most moving experience in my life.
I had a SNR and two nodes removed on 6/7/5.  His wife, a loving friend and part of the Bible Babes group, was there at the hospital before we arrived.  We laughed and joked and shared for about an hour before I left for the procedures.  She read from Psalms 20.  Here&#39;s part, read the rest when you get a chance:  &quot;May he give you the desire of your heart and make all your plans succeed.  We will shout for joy when you are victorious and will lift up our banners in the name of our God.&quot;
God is good to his flock, always seeing that his people are tended to.  I thank God for this chat site and all the people who contribute.  God Bless you all!

Three weeks ago went for my dental cleaning... mentioned to the dentist one of my crowns felt &quot;funny&quot;... maybe getting loose (now, I don&#39;t volunteer for pain... I really thought something was wrong). The dentist said that she wanted to yank it off and reglue it but she had to go to a funeral which was in 15 minutes and needed to have me come back. She is a BC survivor x 7 years and a Christian.  Well, I went back today. The x-rays looked great. She yanked and pulled... the crown won&#39;t budge (it is 25 years old to boot). She had me bite on various things... no reproduction of the discomfort... blasted it with cold water... cold air... nother. She said, &quot;There is absulutely nothing wrong with your crown.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, God must have healed it!&quot;
She looked at me strangely and softly said, &quot;It&#39;s back.&quot;
I said, &quot;What&#39;s back?&quot;
She said, &quot;The cancer,&quot; and pointed to her breast. She saw the surgeon this morning and needs a mastectomy. I told her that I would do anything for her. She asked for my phone numbers which I gladly shared. After a big hug, I went on my way... thinking that if she had taken care of my tooth three weeks ago I wouldn&#39;t have been there for her today. She even said, &quot;God sent you to me!&quot;
I called my husband on the way home and wailed. He sees her also and was saddened by the recurrence. I was asking God what I could get her... when I thought of pink flowers... Yes, that&#39;s it! I went by the florist and saw a lady I hadn&#39;t met... blabbed on about how I went to the dentist and God healed my tooth... I was there for a reason... wanted to send my dentist pink flowers...
The florist stepped away from the computer she was using to put in my order and moved in front of me. Shared that her husband had cancer... 18 months ago given 30 days... needed to get things in order... Found a wonderful onc who didn&#39;t buy into the death sentence... He is also my onc and the dentist&#39;s onc...
Went on to say her sister had a recurrence several years ago of BC but is fine now. However, her niece was just diagnosed with metastatic BC... age 16!!! Her name is Heather. I asked if I could put her on our church prayer chain and she agreed.
Tomorrow is my dentist&#39;s birthday. The flowers will arrive Monday. Surgery will be this month. When I left the florist... I was overcome by how God had moved in the span of 1 1/2 hours. Had been dealing with some unpleasantness this past week and felt that the Godcidences were a reassurance that God is personal and awesome.
He cares so deeply for us and wants us to partcipate in an intimate relationship with Him. He has been tugging on me and I am not sure what plans He has... As a NP, I am privileged to be with people when they are the most vulnerable... The BC has made me braver because I know Him a bit better... I KNOW He is in the valleys... He is my banner... the lifter of my head...
Cancer is part of my testimony. It has allowed His majesty to shine forth in the darkness. Ideclair, you and your pastor will be used in the situation that you have been placed. Before I was  Christian, I didn&#39;t understand victory in adversity... but I am learning. All I know is that if all you have is Jesus... He is more that enough!!

		<Content>I haven&#39;t been on here for a while.  Been busy getting ready to go to Mexico.  I love reading all the new posts, and how God is working.
Today my hubby and I were asked to get up at church and share a bit, before we leave on our trip.  I shared how that I&#39;m glad the year is over, with all the struggles it has held.  And then it occurred to me, came from somewhere down inside, that all this has put a little spot inside of me, something precious, that I hang onto.  It&#39;s like I have been baptised by some suffering.  And a little speck of dirt has been put inside of me, like a speck inside a clam, that turns into a pearl.  I shared that I felt that it is like that for me, that God has turned this experience into something of a pearl to me, that I treasure.  It&#39;s weird isn&#39;t it, how that can be so.  Is it that way with you?
Well, please keep us in your prayers for the next couple of weeks.  Traveling can be stressful.  Well, before we travel can be stressful, just getting ready.  The drive there takes about 48 hours of driving time.  And we have our handicapped boy with us.  We are sure to enjoy ourselves, and enjoy visiting everyone, and forming some new perspectives for what we might do down there in the future.  Whatever.  I&#39;m rambling.  I&#39;m tired.  I&#39;ll update you all when we get back.

		<Content>The Red Sea Rules
The book arrived and I&#39;ve been reading it.  It is very easy, quick reading.  It is so simple that it almost seems too simple.  But, the thoughts and concepts really make sense, and they stick.  I recommend it.  I&#39;ll finish it while we&#39;re gone and let you know more when I get back.  If you think you&#39;d like to get it, though, I recommend e-bay.  My book is used, but in super condition.

		<Content>Quote from The Red Sea Rules:
Pg. 34
&quot;Every time we resist the slightest temptation, we honor God.  Every time we overcome even the smallest problem by trusting and obeying our Lord Jesus, God is glorified in our lives.  Whenever we choose character over convenience, faithfulness over ease, or honesty over deceit, we bring honor to the Lord Himself.  When we serve Him with watertight obedience even in small things, God is glorified just as at the Red Sea.&quot;
NOW HOW&#39;S THAT FOR MOTIVATIN TO MAKE RIGHT CHOICES TODAY?
Have a great day, honoring God.

		<Content>We postponed the prayer retreat.  There were so many conflicts that I am sure it was spiritual warfare.  There was moving kids, funerals, health problems, travel the next day, etc.  We had a great time at our house last night, though.  We are friends with a couple that are leaving in two weeks for Sri Lanka for two years+.  They are with a group from Antioch Community Church that is rebuilding a fishing village that was destroyed in the tsunami.  This group will be building 180 houses with the blessings of the prime minister.  The Sri Lankan govt. gave them the land to build on.  Anyway, they came over along with five other people in our life group, and we had CHURCH!  I felt God had a word for them from Acts 4:29-30, and that is the same thing the Lord had given to the wife this last week.  We had a great time of prayer and encouragement for all of us.  I bought their den furniture and it will be a reminder to pray for them constantly.
Antioch is the church that sponsored the girls that were in the Afganistan prison a few years ago.  It is a very active and mission-minded church.  There have negative reports about them in the New York Times, but to know that the prime minister has a good relationship with them enough to give them the land and encourage the building project is testimony enough for me.
God is good!
May He bless your day!

That is so wonderful to hear!  Will your friends have e-mail where they are going?  Do they have a digital camera?  If they don&#39;t, you should make sure they get one.  Wouldn&#39;t it be great to get pictures of their work there?  I love to hear about people stepping out and doing things like this.  This so great!  I&#39;m glad you had a good word for them from the Lord.  (I looked up the verse.) I&#39;m sure it blessed them greatly.

		<Content>Pat, what an amazing story of the power of God and His constant presence in our lives. The hardest part for me is getting quiet, and listening for His presence and guidance amid all the hustle at work. How you do it, is simply amazing! Or better yet, it&#39;s simply you allowing God to take the reigns. God bless.</Content>

		<Content>I am so upset  because I have an interview, within my hospital, tomorrow for a position that will be a dayshift, in the OR, on Fri/Sat and Mon that will give me around $6-8 an hour raise if I get it. I will be off night shift, feel better, more human! My benefits (long term and short term disability will increase as my income increases, so in the future, if cancer rears it&#39;s ugly head, I&#39;ll be financially in a better place) I am so scared that I can&#39;t stand on my feet in the OR for these long periods of time, even if I get the job. I was so painful, miserable etc last night that I had to call in sick at work. I am so bummed by this, thinking I should just be able to suck it up, and go on. I think the Tamoxifen is the source of some recent issues with pain, and I am hoping that it will go away SOON. I know,  have faith that God will not put me where His grace cannot keep me, but I still am sad. I have been able to do some things in the last 4 months that I would have thought impossible before I returned to work. But, I&#39;m afraid of stepping out on a limb and maybe taking this position, not be able to do it, and then what? I will have lost a position where I currently work, in a job that I know I can do, in familiar surroundings. I know, let it go, let God take it, guess my hormones are just running wild today. Thanks for listening to my rant. I know I should be grateful for what I have, and I am.
As I typed this, I could hear a friend from church saying &quot;it&#39;s when we step out on a limb that we are really trusting God, when we have to be totally dependent upon Him that&#39;s when we show our faith&quot;. Just remembering that helped me, and helps me know that I don&#39;t need to figure this out, just go with it and trust that no matter what, no matter how, it will be okay, God&#39;s in control.</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
You are so right about stepping out on the limb and really trusting God.  It sounds like a great opportunity.  I have found that the aches and pains are getting better all the time.  My onc. said that chemo deconditions our bodies and our muscles are weaker all over.  I have had cramps in places that I did not know could cramp.  I am working on muscle strength and I think I can tell a difference.
I say go for it!  Do your best on the interview and let God handle it.  If you keep it in God&#39;s perspective, it is easier to handle.  That has been my prayer lately when life crashes in on me,&quot;God, I need your perspective.  My perspective is too small for this.&quot;  I was amazed at how it helps.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Well Kathy, I&#39;m back from the peer interview. When someone applies for a job where I work, you are interviewed by 3 or 4 of the people from that department, to see if you&#39;re a good match etc etc. In theory, it sounds good. LOL
Well, it&#39;s for an OR position, as I said. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be getting the call back, but I&#39;m laughing as I type this.  There was one guy, with obvious short man syndrome, who was trying to intimidate me, trying to simulate how stressful it could be in the OR, &quot;with a surgeon screaming at you, nobody to turn to for help, what are you gonna do? hurry up! how will you know what to do? are you up for a challenge? and then he seemed to stress the fact that the weekend circulator now has never been seen having a lunch break, could I handle that? (maybe my obesity gave him the wrong impression??) and then he was trying to tell me how hard it was, could I physically do it after bc and treatment? 12 hours is a long time you know.&quot;  Okay, it sounds like a comedy skit now, but let me first say, I had already told them, I currently work @ this hospital, 12 hour shifts, and I am the only remaining person from night shift since the unit opened in 03, it&#39;s a tough unit, and explained what my duties were, that I had circulated in OR before, just that I wasn&#39;t proficient at orthopedic cases, if they needed someone who could walk right in on trauma cases, then I wasn&#39;t the person for them. Here&#39;s some of the questions, and I PROMISE you this is almost an exact word for word quote in my replies....

Question: what are your goals Rachel?
Answer: to be at home with my family as much as possible. LMAO (oops, did they mean career goals?LOL)
Question: Why do you want to work in the OR?
Answer: I want to be a jack of all trades I guess.
Question: Are you up for a challenge? Do you think you can do this, it&#39;s not what you think, it&#39;s hard, like nothing you&#39;ve ever done before.
Answer: I think I can do it, I&#39;m not stupid, I can learn. (Does my annoyance show with this answer? LOL I already told them I have OR experience, they don&#39;t have a monopoly on it)
Question: You know, 12 hours is a long time. Do you think  you can handle it physically? (this was asked after they were told I had been off work with bc for a few months, isn&#39;t that illegal?)
Answer: I&#39;m doing 12 hour shifts now, have been since March. In fact I&#39;ve missed less days than the other co-ordinators on the floor. (their name for charge nurse)
Question: How will you be able to handle the stress? It&#39;s a high stress enviroment, how do you cope?
Answer: I am responsible for 24 patients, and staff right now, with the ER breathing down my neck for beds, house supervisor calling with transfers, the cath lab sending patients, endoscopy unit sending patients, not enough beds, and nobody on the floors upstairs wanting to take my patients with an inadequate staff, every night I work. In the OR, it&#39;s one patient at a time, I can generally take good care of one person at a time, and make them happy, keep them safe.
Statement: Oh you may have more than one patient at a time.
Answer: You can&#39;t circulate more than one OR case at a time, can&#39;t be in two rooms at once.  I can handle anything, one patient at a time.
Question/Statment: What will you do if you have angry surgeons asking for something you don&#39;t understand, you won&#39;t get all the orientation you&#39;ll need. There will be something you will run into that you haven&#39;t been taught.
Answer: I will ask someone else, there will be other staff in the OR, the surgeon, the OR tech, the assistant, the anestheologist.
Then he said &quot;oh no, they&#39;re not there. You&#39;ve got nobody to ask. What would you do?&quot; (So how would we be doing surgery without anyone but me there?)
Answer: Well, there has to be a policy and procedure book that would cover anything done. If nothing else, I would have to look it up. Or ask the surgeon to clarify what he&#39;s wanting. I&#39;m pretty autonomus, I can punt, if that&#39;s what you mean. I&#39;ve been thrown to the wolves before, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to tell me.
Question: But how will you react to this? how will you cope? (he seemed bent on asking the same type questions, did he think I&#39;d crumble under his Nazi interrogation?)
Answer: Well, I&#39;ve had angry surgeons throw bloody lap sponges and hit the walls, I think I understand how it can be. I&#39;ve never cussed anybody out or been inappropriate if that&#39;s what you mean, so far anyways. I can&#39;t speak for what I&#39;ll do tomorrow.
I swear these were my answers. I can&#39;t believe I had the nerve to do this, but I just didn&#39;t have the time or inclination to put up a front. In fact, sometimes one of the interviewers would laugh when I answered this guy. The other interviewers would just look at Nazi boy with big, round eyes, as if to say &quot;oh my God, what IS he doing?&quot;. Too funny, now that it&#39;s over. At the time, I was not amused. But for some reason, I was totally unable to give the answers they were searching for, I knew what they were searching for, a bullsh** kind of answer. I never planned on this, but in all honesty, I&#39;m proud of who I am, and bc has freed me to be okay with me. If it has done nothing else, I am free to be Rachel.
I just laughed so hard when I came home and told my DH how it went... I said &quot;well, thank God we aren&#39;t depending on this position for our groceries&quot;. He had this shocked look on his face when I told him some of my answers. But, as I told them, what you see is what you get, this is who I am. And, basically that&#39;s it. LOL What a day! and waste of time. And what were they trying to prove with bizarre questions like that? I went to the same training on doing peer interviews, and that was not in the training manual.LOLLOLOL</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
You just might be shocked to find that you actually got the job. You sound like you did a bang up job of answering &quot;Nazi boy&quot;, appropriate name.  I think honesty goes a long way, with me at least.  I&#39;d rather know what someone is thinking than the BS answers.  Those remind me of Eddie Haskell.
We went to Lubbock this weekend for my husband&#39;s family reunion.  We saw Katie, too.  She passed boards, so she is an RN.  She had ACLS last Monday, PALS on Thursday - she passed each one with a 91.  She found out on Thursday that she had to work 7a-7p Fri. and 7-3 on Saturday.  She was a little bummed, but she got to come for some of the reunion on Sat. after work.  She found out Sat. that she also had to work 7a-7p today!  That was not right, but I think it will settle out.  She has finished one class for her RN to BSN program and she thinks she has a B for sure and maybe an A.  She was overwhelmed Saturday night and my sister-in-law and I prayed over her and tried to encourage her.  She seemed better today.
When Katie started in the ER at that hosp., a male LVN kept coming up to her and telling her how she could do things better.  Made her really mad.  I asked how he was doing and she said, &quot;Oh, I took care of that.  I passed ACLS and he didn&#39;t!&quot;  I think she will be fine, but if you think about her please pray for her.
I know this long, but I think you will understand.  I was thinking about how we show the love of God to people and God showed me that &quot;causes&quot; are not really His heart.  We can get on the anti-abortion bandwagon and shout to the high heavens about how wrong it is and the consequences, but not love the individuals.  I am using this as an example.  I think He showed me that He wants us to have a relationship with people and show them first hand what a Christian looks like up close and personal.  We can offend people when we speak too broadly and forcefully.  Anyway, all that to say that I have been trying to discern what to do with my life now that I am feeling so much better.  I had gone to a meeting for Relay for Life and was asked to get together a team.  My heart is just not in this.  It is a very good cause, but I just want a break from thinking about cancer.  I am not in denial about recurrence or anything like that, I just want to think about something else for a while.  So, I decided that I&#39;m not doing the Relay thing.  I am very open to ministering to people with cancer on a one-on-one basis, but I&#39;m not taking time for &quot;causes&quot; right now.
Thanks for letting me ramble.
God bless your day!

		<Content>&quot;Blessed are those that
mourn, for they shall be comforted.&quot; Matthew 5:4
I have been comforted so much by God words through all of you. The Lords light shines though your words.
It is good to be still and listen, I asked God for help for the way I was feeling and he is so good to deliver.
The words , I have put in my heart.
It is so true that you never know who may need to hear
or feel his light and by example you  all show the love of God .
God bless and keep you ~

Sometimes, we don&#39;t take the time to &quot;be still&quot;.  As was mentioned earlier, we get so wrapped up in &quot;us&quot; - what we&#39;re doing or going to do or didn&#39;t do, that we forget to be still!
I did find the verse (with the help of biblegateway.com).
It&#39;s found in Psalm 46, verse 10.
Carrie, something you mentioned reminded me of another verse.  (I found it also with the help of biblegateway.com - love that site, btw).
Anyway, it&#39;s Proverbs 3:3 which says:
&quot;Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart.&quot;
I, too, am glad to have found this thread.  I love hearing all of your thoughts - whether they be up or down.
Have a wonderful day!  Stay cool!
Hugs,
Wendy</Content>

		<Content>I found this today and wanted to share it with you all~
Sometimes He Calms the Storm
All who sail the sea of faith
find out before too long
how quickly blue skies can grow dark
and gentle winds blow strong.
Suddenly fear is like white water
pounding on the soul.
Still we sail on knowing
that our Lord is is control.
Sometimes He calms the storm
with a whispered &quot;Peace be still.&quot;
He can settle any sea,
but it doesn&#39;t mean He will.
Sometimes He holds us close
and lets the wind and waves go wild.
Sometimes He calms the storm,
and other times He calms His child.
He has a reason for each trial
that we pass through in life.
And though we&#39;re shaken
we cannot be pulled apart from Christ.
No matter how the driving rain beats down
on those who hold to faith,
a heart of trust will always
be a quiet peaceful place.
Sometimes He calms the storm
with a whispered &quot;Peace be still.&quot;
He can settle any sea,
but it doesn&#39;t mean He will.
Sometimes He holds us close
and lets the wind and waves go wild.
Sometimes He calms the storm,
and other times He calms His child.
This is so beautiful ~

		<Content>Carrie,
The first set of words are the lyrics to Christian singer Scott Krippayne&#39;s song, &quot;Sometimes He calms the storm&quot;.  In another of those mysterious blessings, I&#39;d fallen in love with that song about two years before I was diagnosed.  I loved the message, which rang so true.  Its message was part of how God eased me into my diagnosis.
Hope M.</Content>

		<Content>Hope,
Until very recent I had never heard these words.
I really need them, I had been feeling very down about the
losses of  Our dear BC sisters lately. And some old doubts had reared there ugly heads. I needed these words and I have put them in my heart. The words have been a blessing to me too. I think I will look to see if I can find the recorded music I would love to hear it.
hugs,
Carrie</Content>

		<Content>I remember when this post was first started.  I lost track of it.  Tomorrow I will take time to read through it.  There will be a lot to nuture me.  I remember how my faith was shaken when I got my dx.  I really thought I had failed somehow and that&#39;s why God allowed me to have cancer.  I worked through that lonely time but I still need help to stay strong in my faith.  I&#39;m glad that you all are continuing to discuss this.  I have been a little low lately also.

		<Content>Carrie,
Scott Krippayne&#39;s &quot;Wild Imagination&quot; CD is where you&#39;ll find that song.  It would be in most Christian stores which sell music, or you can find in on-line at

Susan,  there is a young man here who is 15.  He has battled leukemia twice in his childhood, and was recently diagnosed with multiple brain tumors.  His parents have been requesting prayer (a real campaign, with photos of him, etc.).  His mother recounted the following in a recent email.  Apparently he was reading over her shoulder as she sent out an email requesting prayer.  He became very upset with her because her first request was for his healing, not for &quot;God to be glorified in all of this.&quot;  He was most insistent that regardless of the outcome (in the world&#39;s eyes), that the most important prayer was for God to glorify Himself in this situation.
This was a wonderful story.  This young man GETS IT, even if those around him do not.
Regardless of how our own stories end, how can we lose if we surrender our outcomes to God and trust in His unfailing love?  I pray now that no matter when or how I die, that it will be with a smile on my face and that it will serve as a testimony to someone of God&#39;s existence.
Although we believe in God, it is hard to learn to trust Him.
Hugs all around,
Hope M.</Content>

		<Content>I spoke to Carrie about Kathy, when she was going to see
Christ, she was not angry or unhappy or unfaithful.
I remind myself when I feel a need for a pity party, I realize Kathy&#39;s living of true faith is my goal. It is a life long journey that I am willing to take.
So glad I reached out to Kathy when I needed her, God is driving the car not me.</Content>

		<Content>Hi girls,
Last summer, after my diagnosis and first surgery, my pastor started a mini summer series called, &quot;You Choose the Topic.&quot; which he based on questions &amp;amp; topics that people emailed him or called him about. His first sermon in that series was entitled, &quot;Meeting Long-Term Trouble with Faith.&quot;  Of course, it was such a timely topic!!
It really seems to apply to what we&#39;ve been discussing here - our faith in troubled times.  It&#39;s full of spiritual truths as well as practical, common sense things to do!  In fact, I&#39;m listening to it as I type!  If you are interested in hearing it as well, let me know or pm me, and I will send you the link.
Blessings,
Wendy</Content>

		<Content>Just found this awesome thread...sure to be a regular now... great idea...been itching to share this verse since I found it while going through a nasty divorce from a cheating, lying, rat:
&quot;An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.&quot;
-Proverbs 24:26 (NIV)
It&#39;s downright Shakespearian. Now when I think of kissing that creep, I cringe...
I haven&#39;t read all the posts because, frankly, I don&#39;t have that much patience...honest answer hahahhaha...wonderful to be among other Christians...be well...xo</Content>

I know it will be something for me...I am new to this area and find myself without much Christian support...so anywhere I can learn of something meaningful is somewhere I want to be exposed to.  Thanks, Wendy.  God bless you and your day.</Content>

		<Content>Thanks Wendy,
Got the link.  My husband wants to leave so I&#39;ll come back and read later.
I hope I can say this here and not upset anyone.  I am struggling so right now.  I have been praying all day.  Not even sure why I am having such a hard time.  So many sisters passed on or in hospice.  I had a few minutes here and I logged on.  the first message was someone who has just been diagnosed and has bone mets.  the second, also just dx, had ILC and IBC.  The third post I looked at was from the woman who had lost her baby.  And don&#39;t even get me started on my own issues. I just can&#39;t take it.  There is so much grief.  I know this is all part of Gods plan and I don&#39;t need to understand and I realize I am overreacting right now.  In fact, just jump right over this post and pretend it&#39;s not here.  I just need to vent.  And this seemed to be a place where I could do that and upset the least amount of people.  Blaaaahhhhh.  Thank you for ignoring me.
May God help me to put this into his perspective.

		<Content>Susan, this is more assuredly the place to vent.  And as for not listening, you know that we hear you. That&#39;s exactly what we do.  We listen.  I completely understand that overwhelming feeling.  I think we all go through that from time to time.  So much sorrow, and as we&#39;re coping with the sorrow, we learn that more and more women are being diagnosed with this disease, and at the same time, life is going on with other deaths, other sad news that happens in people&#39;s day to day lives.
We are compassionate and we are caring.  But our shoulders are only so wide.  And there are times when we feel we can&#39;t hold anything more.  I recently learned to let go.  That when I feel my burden is really too heavy, I turn it over to God and ask God to hold those burdens for me.  Even a caring heart can reach a quota and when I&#39;ve handed over my burdens, my grief or my overwhelming sorrow, it allows my heart to start again.
(((((((((((((((((((((((((gentle hugs)))))))))))))))))))))))
A caring heart always speaks up and even those who lift others need a lift every now and then.</Content>

We all feel like that at times. I have struggled with my faith a lot, Kathy passed with a deep faith but it shook mine. We are in this world full of pain and suffering, but our calling is above us. We are in this world but not of this world. God truly understands our human nature he created us! I will pray for you, to find peace and understanding with so much pain in the world.</Content>

I felt so sad and discouraged, and I am not dealing with BC on top of it .
The beautiful ladies here said, &quot;sometimes he calms the storm,
sometimes he calms the child&quot;
those words really struck something with me.
Also Sherry said &quot;she never has to ask why again&quot;
Wow thats how I want to be like when I grow up!
I have been doing like you are doing reading back on this thread.
Sending up prayers that your worries will be lifted and
sadness too.

		<Content>Good evening, ladies, or rather, good morning,
Yes, I&#39;m up waaaay too late...again.
I thought of you all yesterday while at church.  My pastor touched again on the topic I posted about earlier (about 15 posts back).  Anyway,  he is now doing a series called &quot;The God You Can Know&quot; and this past Sunday&#39;s sermon was entitled
&quot;Trusting God in Times of Trouble&quot;.
Once again, how appropriate!!  I guess...... I mean I KNOW that God knows what we need to hear and when we need to hear it.  How comforting!
I&#39;ve decided to go ahead and post the link.  That way it&#39;s in God&#39;s hands, not mine.
So, here&#39;s the link for this past Sunday:
Once you get there, look for the sermon on 6/25/06. Then, choose how you want to listen to it (realplayer or windows).  It also helps to pull up and/or print the pdf file which contains the notes.  Our pastor did go thru lots of verses in this one, but he also put them up on the screen so we didn&#39;t always have to &quot;keep up&quot;.
If you don&#39;t have a bible to read at home, remember that you can always look them up online.  As I mentioned before, I like to use biblegateway.com simply because it&#39;s easy and you choose whatever version you like to read.  Sometimes, I like to compare the versions.  It&#39;s also a great tool for &quot;finding&quot; a verse, like if you&#39;ve forgotten what the reference is, but you kinda know what it says.  (yep, that&#39;s me).  Anyway, hope you enjoy this one, too.
Lastly, if you have any questions at all, please feel free to ask me.  I can&#39;t promise that I&#39;ll have an answer or the correct answer, but I&#39;ll surely try.
I&#39;ll close with a verse.  This is one I included in my emails that I sent to friends and family throughout the past year.  This particular verse was included with the letter that went out just prior to my first surgery last summer:
&quot;The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; He will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.&quot;  Deuteronomy 31:8
Sweet dreams!!

Wrap your arms especially around those going through more tests and surgeries and waiting times.  Make your presence known to all of us.  In Jesus&#39; name I pray... Amen</Content>

		<Content>Lord, protect those traveling this weekend.  Let them enjoy their family time and return home safe.  Be with those at home who are sick, let them know your loving care and kindness.  Lord, let us support one another and lift each other up.  Let your spirit descend upon us and give us knowledge, wisdom and boldness to proclaim your name.  Amen</Content>

by MercyMe
?So I pray
Bring me joy, bring me peace
Bring the chance to be free
Bring me anything that brings You glory
And I know There?ll be days
When this life brings me pain
But if that?s what it takes to praise You
Jesus Bring the Rain
I am Yours regardless of
The dark clouds that may loom above
Because You are much greater than my pain?
Let us continue to praise him no matter what comes our way.</Content>

		<Content>hi ladies
thought I would come by and say hi...
I am getting ready to celebrate my 1 yr survivorship... and I have decided to put together a video clip to express my gratitude and thanks to God for getting me through this very tough year.
Here is the link... I hope you enjoy it.  I have called this video, a new creation.  It is my spiritual journey over the past year.

Feel free to pass on to anyone who you think may enjoy this thanksgiving.  He really is an amazing God.

God bless each and every one of you ladies.

Thanks again for sharing your beautiful work with us.  You have an amazing gift of being able to capture the emotions that many of us have experienced and putting it together in your video&#39;s.  Your new posting was a lovely opening to my day this Friday. Our God is indeed an awesome God!
God Bless you Mel and may you celebrate many, many more years of survivorship.
Hugs,

		<Content>Hello Sisters,
I love this thread and the thoughts, prayers, and lessons we share here.
This weekend when my husband and I were away, we got a very sad message from our cat sitter that our eldest cat Bunky had died.  We adopted him as a little kitten almost exactly 18 years ago, and he seemed to instantly love us and show gratitude for selecting him.  Having Bunky and his sister somehow cemented the bond that became our marriage a few years later.  Bunky was one of the gentlest, kindest, most empathetic, caring, good creatures we have ever known.  He loved everybody; I don&#39;t think I ever him growl.
Last fall we lost his Sister Sissy, and we knew our time with Bunky was limited.  By then we had Miranda, a third cat who was entirely devoted to Bunky, and we knew we would have a challenge getting her to accept new kittens into our cat family.  Bunky led the way, accepting the kittens, loving them, sleeping with them, and Miranda soon followed suit.
During March and April, when I was recovering from chemo, I would sleep late in the mornings.  Bunky would climb on the bed, cuddle next to my side, and gently poke his face into mine when he thought it was time for me to wake.
Dear God, just as Jesus took the little lambs and blessed them, please take Bunky into your arms and reunite him with Sissy.  Please keep him and comfort him and give him a very special place in your kingdom of Angels.
Amen
Mizsissy</Content>

		<Content>Thanks ladies, it means the world to me for you to do this.
I had always thought in my sunny days, I do praise and thanksgiving instead of prayer for wonderful times. Funny I think it is the way you think about it.
Life is so precious, every moment of it.</Content>

		<Content>Cowgirl, it is precious, isn&#39;t it?  And sadly, we have those times of struggle, when it&#39;s just so darned hard.  It&#39;s hard to see the sun through the clouds and the pouring rain, but we know it&#39;s there.  It&#39;s just not &quot;the time&quot; to be looking at the sun.  The &quot;down&quot; times are the times we&#39;re meant to question, seek and cope.  And when the sun comes back out, we do appreciate it more, we are grateful and thankful.
Thoughts are with you and prayers are with you as you are going through this time...I&#39;ll hold the umbrella awhile if your arms are getting tired.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you all for the prayers!  I&#39;m also praying for Karen &amp;amp; cowgirl&#39;s mother.  Sherry is right to offer the Lord thanksgiving &amp;amp; glory for all the beautiful blessings in our everyday lives.
Update:  Plaletes are still too low so I won&#39;t be having chemo tomorrow.  Two weeks in a row...but I have faith the Lord will provide me with strength and wellness as He works within me.
I pray for you all for peace, strength, and encouragement.  Thank you, Lord Jesus Christ for these ladies and for all you continue to bless me with.  Amen.
Love to all &amp;amp; hugs!

		<Content>Dear Ladies-
I just had to let you know how much it has meant to me to have you all praying for me!  Our Pastor&#39;s sermon touched on &quot;Praying in the sunshine&quot; this week, and I think God had him talking just to me!  I am feeling so much better and trying to remember to sing and dance my happiness to the Lord.  I am trying to remember to thank God for all my daily blessings on the good days, just as I cry out too him and AT him on the bad days.  This thread is truly one of my blessings God will be hearing about from me today!
My LAST chemo was today...another blessing.
I will continue to pray for all the concerns that are listed on this board.  May the Lord fill all your days with a measure of joy.
Love,
Deb C.</Content>

		<Content>Carrie-
I love the baby bunny photo.  It reminds me of a woman that used to walk to work every morning and passed in front of my window.  Every spring she would be carrying a big picnic basket with her each day.  I worked for an eye doctor, and when she became or patient I asked her about her basket.
She had a large golden retriever dog that would go out in the yard every spring and bring her baby bunnies!  He never hurt the babies and this gal was go guilt filled that she would raise the babies and then let them go in the yard when they were big enough.  The bunnies were so little that she had to bring them to work with her so she could feed them with a wee little bottle every couple of hours.  she laughed to think that she was probably raising the great-great-great-grandchildren of bunnies she had let go over the years.  She would try so hard to keep her dog in the house or on a leash in the spring, but he always managed to bring home at least a few bunnies.  She figured after a while he thought it was his job!
ANYWAY...didn&#39;t mean to hijack the thread, but thanks for bringing up a fun memory.  She would stop by sometimes and let me help feed that babies...too cute!

		<Content>Am back home, mom went down to see my brother with a friend. They had trouble leaving, broke off an RV air conditioner at mom&#39;s assisted living.
I was out of town, DH didn&#39;t know how to help since we don&#39;t fix A/C at all. Mom was a wreck, oldest was too. But they drove down and got a motel. A/C is getting fixed for the trip back. I am glad brother is overseeing her for a few days. I was 1 1/2 hrs away from her and busy when I heard. I stayed at the camp, and let her and her friend deal with it, as well as DH and the oldest.
I am learning to balance it all, hard lesson but I have to learn it.</Content>

		<Content>Kim, I am so happy for you that your MRI was good.  There are blessings with this bc. We don&#39;t always see them right away, but there are gifts and blessings and we count the blessings as they come.
Cowgirl, I know it&#39;s hard to take that step-back, to not go running every time something goes wrong, even when you know it might be harder for those who have picked up your responsiblity.  I used to feel that if I didn&#39;t do something it wouldn&#39;t get done and for awhile at the beginning of my bc journey, that was true.  My husband hadn&#39;t a clue how to do many things and my sons had to take on more responsibility.  But I saw that as necessary...there were lessons for them from my bc as well.  And someone, somewhere will figure out an answer or a solution to a problem..I don&#39;t have to be superwoman.  That didn&#39;t come to me overnight, believe me, but when it did there was such a sense of peace.  And in some ways, me stepping back allowed others to grow, to find their strength and their ability to lead, to shine.  That was good too.  Finding the balance as you said does take time, but I do believe it is worth the effort, even as we are stressing, worrying and sweating over our decision to &quot;step back&quot; for our own peace of mind, it does make life easier for everyone.  And when you have found that balance for yourself, you will feel so much stronger.  I&#39;m praying for you that the road is not too difficult.
Debbyfive, thank you for keeping us all in your prayers.  That means so much.
I&#39;m now facing a decision with my mother-in-law who will be 90 this year.  She still lives on her own and would like to continue doing so as long as possible.  She has made it clear many times over the years that she does not want to go and live in a home with other people that she does  not know. Her health is beginning to decline which is expected at her age..I think she&#39;s had some small strokes, she&#39;s having dizziness and I am beginning to see her frailty increase.  It may be that we are coming to the point where the decision needs to be made for her as to her future living arrangements and I can see that she will be relieved when the decision has been taken out of her hands.  My husband is not confident in areas such as this (he is an only child) and prefers to think that his mother is just fine.  So it will be up to me to work through this with his mother for the hardest part.  I haven&#39;t had to go through this with either of my parents who passed away before we reached this stage.  Perhaps it will be easier for me than my husband because this is not my parent and there will be less feelings of guilt.  That said, it&#39;s still not something I am looking forward to having to do...if she liked the idea of living with other people it would be so much easier.  I&#39;m looking for strength so that this can be handled with grace and dignity, not to mention love.  Please keep me in your prayers will I am going through this decision making.</Content>

		<Content>dear sisters, a prayer from the most compassionate Mother Teresa.. huggs biondi
                            ************
 The cross is supposed to be swinging when you receive this. I hope it still is. This is cool - had to pass it on. I think we could all use a miracle. I know I certainly can!!! You are in my 7 in 7 seconds. I am not breaking this. No way! I&#39;M TOLD THIS WORKS!!! Just repeat this prayer and see how God moves!! &amp;quot;Lord, I love you and I need you, come into my heart, and bless me, my family, my home, and my friends. Amen.&amp;quot; Share this message with 7 people because God loves you. God bless.  
   &amp;quot;I know God will not give me anything I can&#39;t handle. I just wish that He didn&#39;t trust me so much.&amp;quot;   -- Mother Teresa                        *********
 sorry, the swinging cross didn&#39;t show up when i tried to post it, but you still have a powerful prayer..</Content>

		<Content>It&#39;s so lovely to read these letters.  Thank you everyone for sharing. It has been the worst four years of my life what with losing my mother to this terrible disease and having to come to terms with a mastectomy myself.  I don&#39;t know what I would do without my spiritual practise every morning and belief in God and the angels. I would like to share a daily meditation.
 Once you have taken a step forward in faith, never look backwards or start regretting what you have left behind.  Simply expect the most wonderful future and see it come about.  Leave all the old behind; it is finished.  Br grateful for the lessons you have learnt and for the experiences you have had, which have all helped you to grow and have given you a deeper understanding, but never try to cling on to them.  What is waiting for you is far, far more wonderful than what you have left behind.  When you have placed your life under My direct guidance and direction, how can anything go wrong?  It is when you have taken a step forward and then wonder if you have done right, and you allow doubts and fears in, that things begin to crowd in on you, and you find yourself bowed down by the weight of your decision.  Therefore let go, release the past and move forward with your heart filled with love and gratitude.

 November 13, 2007 -- God is in Control -- Romans 8:28-29 
             Nothing that happens is beyond God&#39;s control. Ultimately, whatever comes into our life is either sent by our Father or permitted by Him, and that which does not enter is withheld according to His will. But believers sometimes get so caught up in the moment that they forget about the Lord&#39;s omnipotence. Then when life is challenging or uncomfortable, the temptation is to react against whatever seems to be causing them trouble. Fired? Blame the boss. Single? Blame the opposite sex.
             To illustrate this idea, think about a child who has to swallow a nasty-tasting antibiotic. In a fit of frustration, he slaps away the bottle from his mother&#39;s hand, even though the container is only a &amp;quot;secondary agent.&amp;quot; Mom is the one who dispenses the medicine, but since he cannot slap her, he turns his irritation against the vessel.
             When we &amp;quot;slap away the bottle,&amp;quot; we take out our anger and resentment on the vessel the Lord is using instead of accepting that His will is at work. God does assure us He is working out the details of our life for good, but we cannot assume this means everything will turn out to our liking.
             Sometimes it&#39;s easier to turn our wrath against an earthly agent than to be honest with our Father about frustration over our circumstances. But God welcomes honesty. Both Jesus and the apostle Paul cried out to Him in anguish (Matthew 26:39; 2 Corinthians 12:7-9). If we recognize that God is in control and guiding our future for good, then we will not stay discouraged for long.</Content>

		<Content>A Christmas Prayer
               A CHILD&#39;S VIEW
         Snowflakes softly falling
                 Upon your window play,
         Your blankets snug around you,
                 into sleep you drift away.
         I bend to gently kiss you,
                 when I see that on the floor
         There&#39;s a letter, neatly written,
                 I wonder who it&#39;s for.
         I quietly unfold it
                 making sure you&#39;re still asleep,
         It&#39;s a Christmas list for Santa--
                 one my heart will always keep.
         It started just as always
                 with the toys seen on TV,
         A new watch for your father
                 and a winter coat for me.
         But as my eyes read on
                 I could see that deep inside
         There were many things you wished for
                 that your loving heart would hide.
         You asked if your friend Molly
                 could have another dad;
         It seems her father hits her
                 and it makes you very sad.
         Then you asked dear Santa
                 if the neighbors down the street
         Could find a job, that he might have
                 some food, and clothes, and heat.
         You saw a family on the news
                 whose house had blown away;
         &amp;quot;Dear Santa, send them just one thing
                 a place where they can stay.&amp;quot;
         &amp;quot;And Santa, those four cookies
                 that I left you for a treat,
         Could you take them to the children
                 who have nothing else to eat?&amp;quot;
         &amp;quot;Do you know that little bear I have--
                 the one I love so dear?
         I&#39;m leaving it for you to take
                 to Africa this year.&amp;quot;
         &amp;quot;And as you fly your reindeer
                 on this night of Jesus&#39; birth,
         Could your magic bring to everyone
                 goodwill and peace on earth?&amp;quot;
         &amp;quot;There&#39;s one last thing before you go--
                 so grateful I would be--
         If you&#39;d smile at Baby Jesus
                 in the manger by our tree.&amp;quot;
         I pulled the letter close to me;
                 I felt it melt my heart.
         Those tiny hands had written
                 what no other could impart.
         &amp;quot;And a little child shall lead them,&amp;quot;
                 was whispered in my ear
         As I watched you sleep on Christmas Eve
                 while Santa Claus was here.</Content>

		<Content>Heavenly Father, You are intimately aware of the struggle many are experiencing -- the pain and the despair. You know the desire of their hearts to be healed of this illness. I ask now for Your healing touch. I know that You are able and that just like in Bible times, You can heal them.
&amp;quot;I also understand that You will chose what is best for them. I pray that through this trial, they will draw close to You -- that You will be their comfort and strength. I pray that ultimately, whatever happens, You will be glorified. I pray this in Jesus&#39; name, Amen.&amp;quot;</Content>

		<Content>Special prayers for Mary Katherine
 Hearts are heavy now, dear Lord For WAR is looming there. Our prayers are calling out to you, Our thoughts too much to bear. Be with our loved ones--THEY NEED YOU. Guide them, lead them, see them through. Bless our leader, for we know, He asks Your blessings, and needs them so. Protect the innocent,  shield their lives, As bombs and missiles streak the skies. Open our hearts and fill us with grace, Guard our loved ones in that place. This I say, in earnest prayer, THANK YOU LORD I know YOU&#39;RE there.</Content>

		<Content>Only God Can Change You (From Joyce Meyer Starting Your Day Right)
Lord, be merciful and gracious to me; heal my inner self, for I have sinned against You.
--Psalm 41:4
Don&#39;t obsess over your faults, or you will never enjoy the life that Jesus died to give you.  Only God can change you, so talk to Him about your desires.  The Word says that those who wait on the Lord will change (see Isaiah 40:31)  ... Enjoy yourself, and lighten up!  Take the right steps today toward the change you want to make by asking God to help you all day long.
I am writing this here because I so need to hear it, again and again and again.

		<Content>Hi ladies,
I&#39;ve tried to post several times, but can&#39;t find the words to say.  My heart is so heavy.  A friend from church is in her last moments here on this earth.  She has battled bc several times.  I know that God knows the day He&#39;ll call us home, but it has been so hard to see her suffer.  She has three children (mid-school and elem. school).  I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s actually gone yet, but I expect to get the word anytime now.  I thought I was handling this all okay, but it&#39;s just hitting so close to home.
Lord Jesus, comfort her children, her husband, her sister and other family members.  Help them to know that she will be at peace and no longer in any pain. Throughout all of this, may Your name be glorified.  In Your name, I pray.
Your child, Wendy</Content>

		<Content>Wendy,
I know how hard it is to see someone suffer with bc. All I can say is God is his place, he is in control. While we do not understand the reasoning behind taking a mother. We know that God will be there to comfort her children and welcome her into his presence.
I love you and I will pray for her and her family, and for you as you go through the journey of acceptance. I know how hard it can be. Just lean on him.</Content>

		<Content>Peggy &amp;amp; Cowgirl,
Thank you!  When I woke up this morning, I logged on and had a half dozen emails regarding my friend Lorie.  She passed away last night around 1:30 am.  I was up until 2:00 thinking about her and praying for her.  It was an honor to pray for her as she was ushered into Heaven.
One of the emails I just read talked about that since she was such a &quot;horse gal&quot;, all of her friends that were riders will be having one last trail ride prior to her funeral in her honor - kind of a processional.  She would have loved that!
Trusting in Him,
Wendy
p.s.  Carrie, I listened to your link last night.  We sing many of those songs in church.  It was comforting to me.  Thank you!</Content>

		<Content>Hello sisters-in-Christ ... I just found this site a week ago and am still finding all the little &quot;nooks and crannies&quot; of it, this morning I stumbled upon this thread, what a gift!  I haven&#39;t read it all by any means but plan to as soon as I have some free time.  Just wanted to thank all of you for being here and I look forward to the blessings this thread (and this journey with BC) hold for me.

Love is patient,love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.
1 Corinthians 13:4-7

		<Content>Welcome Kat in Texas and Victoriousone.  I had no idea Nicole meant Victory of the People.
I have a small favor to ask.  My brother and sister-in-laws doggie, Buster, died tonite.  He was fainting and they found out his red blood cells were attacking the rest of his blood.  He developed a blood clot while at the vet hospital and passed away. They are so sad. Please, prayers for comfort for Mike and Cherie.
thanks,

I  believe that the class of 7th graders I had last year was chosen by the Lord to be with me during my treatmant last year.  They weren&#39;t the &quot;best&quot; students but they were the best for me and all that I went through.

		<Content>Rachel,
I am a firm beleiver that things happen for a reason.  Truly you were sent to guide this lady and calm her fears.  I always say the Lord works in mysterious ways.  My faith has gotten me through this ordeal and I have given my trouble up to the Lord to handle.  It makes me rest easier.
I beleive we all can help someone else with our experience.  That is why any time anyone wants to talk about my bc I will.  I left my name at the plastic surgeon&#39;s office for anyone who wants to talk about the reconstruction procedure.  I only hope I can help someone else.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you, Rachel, for starting this!  It is so good to hear stories like that; they are real faith builders.  My family had changed churches about a year before I was dx, and we had been going to our Sunday school class for about 2 months.  When I shared my prayer request, a lady came up to me and told me about her experience 10 years ago, she was a stage III, and has been NED.  Another lady shared with me about a week later about her mastectomy 18 years ago.  I am a firm believer that God does not waste our pain, and the verse in II Corinthians 1:3-4  &quot;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.&quot;
God is so good and I want to live my gloriously!
God bless your day!

		<Content>There&#39;s a girl in my sunday school class that has metastatic thyroid cancer.  she has a 14 mo. old son.  she has known about this since she was 17, but treatments had failed her.  She had a few spots on pelvis and spine (all very, very tiny) - but nothing else at all.  She had no additional treatment - had been told that since she didn&#39;t respond to the iodine treatment, they&#39;d done all they could do.
She started going to the church in June, this past year also.  We were in the same class, would say hello, etc.  I didn&#39;t know about her cancer, she didn&#39;t know about mine.  She was 27, I was 32 - we both had kids in the children&#39;s program - but really didn&#39;t click.  I recurred in September, she found out it had gone into her lungs in November or so...  I prodded her to look somewhere else for a trial drug - she found one at OSU in Ohio.  Angel flights are taking her there for her treatments (I mentioned those to her because someone posted about them on this board...)
We have become fast friends.  I have someone to cry to when I&#39;m frustrated, with no guilt -- so does she.  She doesn&#39;t live near this church, didn&#39;t know anyone there - I found this church on the internet when we moved to this town.... A bazillion sunday school classes, we pick the same one.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidence.  I needed someone, so did she.  God put us together -- very awesome.</Content>

		<Content>Denisa, let me tell you in very clear terms, I posted this thread here because I WANT to, felt lead to, and know that many more women browse this forum more than the others which are stuck way down low on the list of forums. I deliberately put the title as Spiritual/Christian thread BECAUSE I want to avoid posts such as yours. Also, I forewarned anyone who could have possibly missed the subject that they were about to read a post dedicated to this topic

&quot;That&#39;s a notice for anyone who prefers to NOT be exposed to this type thread. Turn back now, or forever hold your peace.. &quot;

Now, I will make myself even more clear, for you or anyone else who is reading this, I am under no obligation to warn you of the forum, nor content. I am under no compulsion to listen to unsolicited advice as to where to post my thread. I do not expect to hear from anyone else with regard to what I have posted or where it is posted. If I am pushed, I will be forced to take this up with the moderators, and it would actually be considered harrassment. Do I make myself clear? Was there anything unclear in my subject line or first few sentences???  Were you forced to continue reading this against your will?  were you tricked into reading this? or were you warned more than once, just in case you didn&#39;t get the gist of the subject?? I have not said one thing in response to the unsolicited PM&#39;s or posts advising me how much they do not approve of the many of us who write of our faith, religious views, etc. That is entirely everyone&#39;s right to say what they do or don&#39;t want to read. We&#39;ve discussed this subject, to a long slow death over the past weeks. But, women who deliberately come to a thread to cause trouble, ignoring the subject line, then reading the post and makeing nasty comments, make my blood boil. And I mean that with all my heart. As for anyone who is reading this, and there will be so many that this does not apply to, I apologize for the rant, but I will not tolerate posts like the one from Denisa without comment.</Content>

		<Content>Chapter 2
So, then later in the night, I got another patient, who was over 60 who was there for an unrelated problem. In doing her assessment, and interview, I realize she is a bc survivor. I asked her: how long ago was your surgery? and SHE CAN&#39;T REMEMBER! Girls, isn&#39;t that a beautiful sign? Now this lady didn&#39;t have Alzeheimer&#39;s, she was sharp as a tack. It had become so unimportant to her, that she nearly forgot when it was. As it turned out, it wasn&#39;t that long ago, less than 10 years, and she had had lymph nodes taken as well. That lady was sent to me, to give me hope. And she sure did, Monday night.</Content>

		<Content>Chapter 3
This chapter begins Tuesday night. These are so long, I&#39;m making them into chapters, thanks for bearing with me here. So, my unit is to admit people from the ER or direct admission from MD offices, day or night. Like most hospitals, we are so full, there&#39;s often a wait for a bed in our unit, and sometimes no beds available in the hospital upstairs, so they even get &quot;stuck&quot; in our unit til a bed opens up (don&#39;t ask how, in the middle of the night
).
A co-worker, Cindy, came to me immediately when I come on the floor. Cindy has been a blessing to me,  her mom just passed away with ovarian cancer, she&#39;s has a rough, tough exterior but is all heart underneath. Cindy told me that there was a patient of Dr. X waiting for us to get an empty bed, she was very sick,  waiting in the lobby area. I knew this was an onc patient, by the doctor&#39;s name. She forewarned me, the lady and her family are kinda upset, thought maybe  we could make it a little easier for them while they wait. She introduces me to them, and then leaves, her shift has ended. The patient, I&#39;ll call her Mrs. K, was about 60, full head of hair, didn&#39;t look emaciated, nor like a cancer patient, but it was obvious she was feeling terribly. She was wrapped up in  blankets,  a heavy jacket, and clothing underneath. It&#39;s Florida, 70 degrees here. She was quite vocal, and irritated about having to wait. After all, she felt miserable! I sat down, told her I was going to start with her admission from the lobby, to speed things along, so when her bed was ready on the onc. unit, we would be that much closer to getting her where she needed to be. Me, her and her sister were the only ones there.  I got her extra blankets, and tried to make her comfortable, made her some hot tea, and she seemed more relaxed. (Thank you Lord) I started her interview, and for sake of time, I will just type events of her life over the past 8 years:
Diagnosed with bc &#39;97 8 of 16 nodes pos., chemo, mast., recon.
June &#39;02 bc mets to abdomen and colon, surgically removed large portions of the colon,started Herceptin, went into remission, did well.
Lost a sister to ovarian cancer
Sometime after that, she lost her daughter to ovarian cancer
Dec. 04 lost her husband to Melanoma
Jan. 05 they found the cause of abd pain in the right side was mets wrapped all around the colon, and the tumor was removed, started Gemzar
Hasn&#39;t really felt well since surgery, not gotten her &quot;strength back&quot;, is a co-ordinator and leader in cancer walks etc., very active in her church and with the ACS.
Came to us cuz she had been feeling poorly and spiked a fever of 103 that evening. She had taken a break from the Gemzar to recover from some of the stress @ onc suggestion. This woman was an amazing woman, I felt such a bond, a connection with her from the beginning. After hearing her history, I was nearly in tears. She had such a good attitude, very very well educated on cancer, treatments etc. I told her I had just finished my chemo and it was my 2nd night back LOL I got her to a bed, then up to her room in about an hour and a half. Meantime, I tell her what a pleasure she has been. She told me, &quot;honey, it&#39;s the Lord. I couldn&#39;t have done anything without Him. It was still pretty hard, but He made it possible for me to get thru it.&quot; What a beautiful statement! Before she went to her unit, she told me she hoped that I was finished with bc treatment, didn&#39;t have to go thru what she&#39;s been thru. I told her I hoped so too, but if I did have to, I hoped I could be like her, she had such a wonderful spirit despite the whole ordeal.
This person was given to me to give me hope too.
She gives us an example of a strong faith, the will to live, the wonders of modern medicine and the everyday miracles of God. What a testimony, I wish each of you could have met her, her fever was 103.9 when I was admitting her, terribly sick lady, but she was a witness to me, how awesome is that?</Content>

Thanks for those verses Kathy, seems like I&#39;ve never really read them for their true meaning til today.  I see y&#39;all know exactly what I mean in this thread. And Kimmy, how amazing that you met this woman, can there be any doubt that your friendship was given to you by God??  Sometimes it&#39;s things like your post, Kathy&#39;s and Jill&#39;s that convince me the most, God is good, all the time. I love it when I see how HE&#39;s worked small miracles all along the way, to get me/us where we need to be, and  right on time.  Solly, you will be a blessing to many women, never doubt that.

Final Chapter
Tuesday morning, I was given a 47 yr old female who  thought she had hurt her back, doing repairs and clean up during the Hurricane in September. Her back had gotten worse and worse, and for the past week, she had lost the ability to walk at all, and incontinent of her bowel and bladder at times. She was scheduled to go to Shands in Gainsville the next day to be evaluated. Unfortunately, she was being very badly undermedicated, had only recently gotten her first rx for Percocet, which wasn&#39;t helping. The nurse before me, got a order for Morphine in her IV every 2 hours if needed. I mean, really, this woman was suffering so badly, without a word. That&#39;s the least she deserved. She slept for a few hours  straight, for the first time in weeks. We decided we would keep her as comfortable as we could. As it turned out, she had metastatic tumors all along her spine. She apparently didn&#39;t want to tell them when she came into the ER, seeking relief from this pain. Luckily, her boyfriend knew what she had been told by another doctor, and he passed this on to us. Was she in denial?? Not sure why she chose to remain quiet about this. She was so skinny and frail looking. I offered to have someone come pray for her, and she looked so relieved, she jumped at the opportunity. Truthfully, I am not comfortable praying for a patient outloud. I wish I were at that point in my life. Prayer is encouraged at our hospital, a Catholic facility. This woman taught me to be grateful for the ablilty to walk and work at my job. I needed to suck it up, quit complaining about being tired, etc. She was suffering without a word, it put me to shame. I hope she gets the care she needs,  I think she was uninsured. I would like to say our hospital admits and treats patients without regard for their ability to pay. I know that&#39;s considered one of the mission statements . I see it in action daily, but you never know who gets left out. God bless her.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you, dear Rachel for such a lovely post.
I think I told the story of the day I was diagnosed and a young gal (to me) went with me to a chest x-ray site and she looked at me and whispered, I am a 17 year survivor of Malignant Melanoma.  Wow, I loved her for that.  It was just what I needed on that mind-numbing day.
Yes, Our Lord takes care of us.  He leads us to where he wants us to be.
Thank you Rachel.

		<Content>Hi, Rachel.  I&#39;m so glad you started this thread!  I do believe that God puts people together!  I went to my onc last Friday for lab work.  The minute I walked in my favorite onc nurse yelled&#39; &quot;Sherri, I was just telling this family about you!  You&#39;re one of our success stories.  Come over here and explain to this family about neoadjuvant chemo.  They think all the nurses here are just sticking together!&quot;  Well, I went through my story about how neoadjuvant chemo is used quite often and that many studies have shown that it can lead to better outcomes, yada,yada,yada.  This girl (32 y/o) had just come from her surgeon who told her the tumor was to large to do surgery on.  The devastation on her face was heartwrenching.  Her husband and parents had that shell shocked look that we all know too well.  I told her my mass started out at 8cm and she about fell over and started crying (with relief).  I said, &quot;See, I made you feel better didn&#39;t I?&quot;  Anyway, she is a stage 3 and we have exchanged numbers and it feels so good to be there for someone who really needs support right now.  She needs me but I especially need her.  I have asked the Lord to show me what He wants me to do with this entire situation.  I know this is part of the answer I&#39;ve been looking for!</Content>

		<Content>Sherri, your post is just like Kimmy&#39;s. It&#39;s without a doubt, the hand of God putting the people who need  us in our lives. It&#39;s so healing to be of use to someone else isn&#39;t it? They are giving us so much more than they imagine, just by allowing us to be there for them. I guess it means we really are moving on. I know your heart felt like it was gonna explode with joy, didn&#39;t it? I can&#39;t put it into words, how good it feels to realize I am in  the midst of something so much greater than I could ever be. I see the same sentiment all thru these posts. There is a bond among some cancer patients that is so strong, so tangible, you can almost  reach out and touch it. Our bodies may be touched by cancer ....but our soul can blossom.</Content>

		<Content>I had chemo first , so when we went on a preplanned trip to Florida after my second chemo I was still pretty shell-shocked. My hair was coming out and I felt pretty miserable and far away from my support group. We were at a restaurant and a lady came up to me and asked if i was losing my hair. I said yes and she told me that she had been through this 10 years ago and was feeling great. I called her my angel. I think God knew I needed her to speak to me then.
Since then I have tried to be a support for others when they are diagnosed. In our small town I am usually one of the first ones called by friends or family so I can offer support and encouragement. What an honor!
Now - to just touch briefly on some unpleasantness in this thread. Rachel, Denisa is a wonderful, caring person. I think that you misunderstood her intentions. She wasn&#39;t being critical. I have suggested people move posts at times so that the most people will look at them (maybe a newbie posts under Moving Beyond or something like that.)
So - let&#39;s remember we&#39;re all in this together.
Take care everyone,  Barb</Content>

		<Content>Rachel - Thanks for starting this post.  I truly believe God is taking my breast cancer experience and is going to use it as a ministry tool. I have already been connected with several other newly diagnosed women (some Christian and some not.) This whole ordeal has given me a chance to witness to a neighbor and others who I would have probably never talked to about my faith. I loved the Corinthian verse - I shared that verse with a friend several years ago when her husband was diagnosed with a &quot;terminal&quot; brain tumor - he&#39;s alive and doing well!  I shared the verse with her because my son was born with a neuroblastoma (yes, cancer) and wanted her to know how God had walked with us thru that and had continued to be faithful to us even though our son was left physically and mentally disabled. Who knew that in August 2004, she would be ministering to me when I was the one with the diagnosis??
God is good, even when our circumstances are not.  Thanks again for your lovely stories  (good luck with your rads!!)

		<Content>Rachel-Thanks for taking the time to share all of your stories. I too believe everything happens for a reason. You returning to work at a certain time is not coincidence!
I turned this all over to the Lord the week of diagnosis, esp waiting for result of the catscan and bone scan, I just decided I couldn&#39;t do it alone. The Lord uses us in many ways, and I think our strength through Him in going through this is a witness to others. And I am a firm believer in prayer.
I have a neat story. I got a prayer and Bible verse sent to me from another cancer survivor(on this board!) in California-the verse is that &quot;I will clothe myself in the warm white light of Jesus and all good things will come to me&quot;. I wrote it on a piece of paper and took it with me. In presurgery I asked the anesthesiogolist (sp???) if he could hold to my paper for me during the surgery. He said a paper would be fine under my pillow. When I got to the OR I was really cold, so the surgeon asked for some nice warm blankets. A nurse carried in two WHITE warm blankets. I knew it would all be ok. Other people in the recovery room had blue and pink blankets, so I knew it was not a coincidence. The paper was still with me in recovery and my room. I sent that on to someone else who was having her surgery a few days later.
Just keep looking for those messages of hope from Him!

		<Content>Heidi and Tricia, what  awesome testimonys! That white blanket Heidi! that was truly amazing! You&#39;re a much stronger woman that I am, I don&#39;t know if I could have given my paper away.  I hope that I could be that selfless. I know that really had an impact on the person you gave it to.  Tricia, I had a friend whose brother had the same type cancer as your son, I think. If I&#39;m correct, that&#39;s almost always fatal isn&#39;t it? You know what we give or do is given back to us 10 times over, and that woman you comforted was there for you Tricia. God is good, all the time. I love reading these testimonies so much. This thread was meant to be an uplifting one, but I never imagined how many  powerful testimonies would be written. Sandy, glad you enjoyed the thread, hope it gets more and more testimonies added along the way.</Content>

		<Content>I may have something to share. As many of you know, there has been a lot of personal pain in my life recently, not breast cancer related. I&#39;ve been struggling with this, and it&#39;s been a huge blow to my self-esteem.  I feel strong some days, but other days I just feel like life is too hard.  Yesterday was one of those days; I really felt down.
Before bed, I prayed for strength and guidance. I also asked if God wanted me to know something, to make it obvious, because I might not pick up on it.
I climbed into bed and picked up a book at random on the nightstand (not the one I was reading, somehow I couldn&#39;t find that one).  I opened it up to the middle, just seeing what the book was about, and the first page I saw had this chapter title:  Hope Found.  The chapter says that hope is overused as a word, it&#39;s lost it&#39;s power to move people, we use it casually, such as &quot;I hope I get this job. Overusing a word that so well demonstrates our fervent need for strength when the world has gone mad for us stops us from hearing it&#39;s true meaning.  We don&#39;t really understand the meaning and value of our hope until it is &quot;blown by winds of tragedy right out of our hands. Then, because we are on our hands and knees searching for it, each speck we can recover is more precious than the last.&quot; &quot;Hope that is damaged as a result of setbacks, losses and failures may not be easily repaired, but opportunities to find new hope in the world around us are plentiful, if we know where to look.&quot;  There is a long chapter about this, and reading it was very helpful.</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
Thank you so much for starting this uplifting thread.  I am also a true believer in the power of prayer.  I love to hear the stories of how God has guided our lives.   &quot; God is good, even when our circumstances are not.&quot;  Tricia in Texas, I love that and it is so true.  I have asked  God to lead me in whatever direction that my cancer experience can be used for his ministry as well.

I have a friend whose daughter was in a terrible car accident when she was a teenager.   She had to be cut out of her car and was air lifted  to the best trauma hospital in our area.  She had very serious injuries including a very serious brain injury.  She wasn&#39;t expected to live through the night.  The doctors called the family in to be with her and told them that the brain injury was so severe that the only way that she could possibly live would be a miracle.  We prayed and requested prayers from everybody that we knew and we started a prayer chain.  There were people praying for this child all across this country.  We all prayed and prayed.  She lived through the night and the doctors were very relieved but they acknowledged that this was strictly a miracle that medically there was nothing more that they could do,  she was on life support and her brain continued to bleed and swell and the pressure continued to rise even though  she had a shunt to release the blood to hopefully allow the swelling to go down.  But it didn&#39;t go down it continued to swell.  Once again we were told that she would not make it through the night, that she now had so much swelling in her brain and so much pressure that she was showing no brain activity on the EEG, and that there was nothing more they could do, but to pray.  I am serious the trauma doctors told us to pray.  That told us that they had witnessed many miracles and that a miracle is the only chance that this child had. People across the country continued to pray for this child and once again she made it through the night. The doctors were happy. Of course so were we.   She started to improve slightly and they started picking up brain activity again.  Then her brain would swell so seriously that she would lose brain activity and they wouldn&#39;t expect her to live through the night. This went on and on for weeks.  She was in a coma.  And finally they said she would live but she would be brain damaged.  People continued to pray for this child and after 5 weeks she  woke up and started talking.  She had to learn to walk again and to feed herself, but within 4 months she was walking and talking and to see her and to talk to her you would never know that anything had ever happened to her.  She graduated High School and now attends college and she has NO brain damage.  God healed her completely. God is good.

As Sachi felt the need to defend denisa, I also feel the need to defend Rachel.  Because I feel that Rachel is a wonderful, caring person, and I don&#39;t think that she misunderstood denisa&#39;s intentions at all.

Rachel,  I believe that you are allowed to post your thread  in this forum or any other forum.  As far as I know we have not been censored and made to post an inspiring Christian thread in a certain forum.  You made it quite clear what your thread was about and you posted a warning.  I think that you went beyond any  obligations to make sure that no one was offended and I don&#39;t think that anyone should have been.  It is annoying when you cannot post a thread with your thanks and beliefs without someone finding fault and basically telling you this type of thread is not welcome on this forum.


Quote:
&quot;there is a special section called Inspiration and/or Prayers on here that was especially and specifically set up for spiritual/christian threads after some members protested in the past. it was set up to enable those who are interested to go directly there instead of having religious discussions showing up in other threads for those who are not interested. i think this would truly qualify as an inspirational story for there...actually it was a very nice story.


&quot;Having religious discussions showing up in other &quot;threads&quot;  for those who are not interested does not apply to this thread.  I must say that Rachel&#39;s thread did not show up in &quot;other threads&quot; for those who are not interested.  Rachel started her own thread, and her subject line plainly states that this is a &quot;Spiritual/Christian Thread She did not post this in someone else&#39;s thread, for someone to stumble into it without warning, she started her own thread.    And  of course posting a Spiritual/Christian  thread in any forum can be overlooked by anyone who is offended especially when it is in the title and there is a warning.  I don&#39;t see the relevance of protesting this thread in this forum.  There are many subjects posted here that also have their own &quot;special sections&quot;, (forums), but I  think the only time they are asked to post in a specific forum is when they would get a larger response to their questions.  Such as Sachi mentioned:  &quot; I have suggested people move posts at times so that the most people will look at them (maybe a newbie posts under Moving Beyond or something like that.)&quot;
It seems this is done to help the person who posted the thread not to censor them.
Thanks again for this uplifting thread.</Content>

		<Content>JoJo,there&#39;s not a bit of doubt where that childs healing came from! It&#39;s as if the reason behind her setbacks was to deliberately show the power of prayer, that it couldn&#39;t be mistaken for a fluke, over and over again. Thanks for sharing that beautiful story and  thanks for saying so eloquently, what I couldn&#39;t put into words. I never ever meant to offend anyone, truly I didn&#39;t. I meant this as an uplifting thread, giving God the praise for his wonderful mercy during this, and how we can see His hand at work, caring for us in the midst of this disease. It&#39;s a pretty non-denominational post. I want to respect the right of others that don&#39;t believe, that&#39;s why I titled the thread, so it couldn&#39;t just &quot;appear&quot; withoout someone deliberately choosing to read it.  I have given thought to my reply to denisa, and was it too harsh? I wouldn&#39;t be a fair judge of that.  With my big mouth, I have invested in a big roll of duct tape.
All I know is, I hate some of this thread has become so ugly. That&#39;s the direct opposite of my intentions. It was meant to be spiritul thread, which others could add to, and would benefit anyone who believed in God but found themselves depressed, in doubt, wondering if we&#39;re struggling through this world all alone, etc. The type of patients I were given was not a freak accident. They blessed me so much more than I could have ever  blessed them. I just wanted to express my gratitude for them and the Lord. He turned a fearful time, for me, into a wonderful experience, That&#39;s all I was trying say.
Remember when I talked about my Sunday School class praying over me for this return to work? I&#39;ll be telling them  about this thread, and the beautiful examples y&#39;all have given of God&#39;s presence. Your posts will really touch them, just like they did me, and most of all, they will understand; as a result of their prayer for me, a large number of women have begun sharing their faith building experiences too, becoming a huge witness to anyone who would like to read it. Of course, I&#39;ll selectively leave  out our our controversial stuff.
Women, we&#39;re really scrappers sometimes.
I think it&#39;s the estrogen deficit.</Content>

		<Content>Gee Rachel, I think if I posted all the ways God has shown himself to me through my bc journey it would be a book! So I&#39;ve had a hard time deciding which story to share with you lovely people.
I think one of my favorites is one from chemo days, because it is so darn practical and shows how God numbers every hair on our heads (has anyone else thought about that while they watch the incredible number of hairs falling out after chemo?!LOL)
It was after my first chemo, which for reasons I won&#39;t go into here, had been fairly difficult (jerky doctor at the clinic, not such a great nurse first try, terrible veins, bad poke, etc. etc. etc.) Anyway, we got through that and they sent me home w/ meds to &quot;take when I needed them&quot;. As you all know, much better to take them preventatively, so I ended up throwing up for two days. By the second night, believe it or not, I still wasn&#39;t discouraged but I was tired. I KNOW that the reason I wasn&#39;t discouraged was because of the huge no. of folks praying for me. Anyway, it was 1:30 am, I had once again gotten up from bed to be sick, and I prayed &quot;Lord, I can do this, I know I can, with Your help. But I&#39;m getting tired and I sure would love some suggestions about how to get past this puking&quot;. Well, I turned around to go back in my bedroom and there was my zofran bottle. I had been told to ONLY TAKE 2 a day. Well, God made it clear to me that I should take a third. So I did, didn&#39;t wait to call the dr., wake him up, wake my husband. I figured HE was the authority. And of course, that did the trick (along with the phenergan which I&#39;d been using too).
Next am I called the oncology folks and told them I needed 3 per day for the first few days after chemo--which they agreed was just fine! Of course I wish they had told me that earlier, but then again, it was so very helpful to me to see God working to care for me in this &quot;little&quot; thing and so directly. Every time He cares for us this way it just reinforces our trust in Him, and it also, for me, jumpstarts my worship.
Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful to remember to read these stories before church Sunday so we can be prepared to worship Him more fully and thank him more knowledgeably!
Rachel, I am so very glad that God has shown you His love and care for you as you returned to work. I remember, I think, that you were a bit concerned about the transition, but it sounds as though it has been a great blessing to you.
Praise God from whom all blessings flow.

I have read the thread on Pepper&#39;s niece Marissa is closer to dying than not.
Why is God merciful to some but not others.
Why should a beautiful child be forced to endure such  horrendous and hideous situation.
I&#39;m not invalidating what you ladies have experienced. Im glad that you have been so uplifted and inspired and useful to others.
But when I read stories like Marissa, I think God seems pretty cruel and lacking in fairness and justice.

		<Content>Nan, EXACTLY, it&#39;s amid the tiny, insignificant things that blow my mind. I mean, for Him to guide us, help us etc. thru little stuff, means so much to me. I assumed that my smoking was MY problem, never even considered asking for relief from my nicotine addiction. It was like, ok Rachel, you know it&#39;s wrong, so stop it! Why are you so weak? And then giving it up to our Lord, I was able to stop, cold turkey, after smoking over 20 something odd years, no withdrawl symptoms. I even thought, oh, I&#39;ll sure disappoint these people who&#39;ve prayed for me when I start back smoking. I kid you not! well, guess what I learned from that? My success in kicking my nicotine addiction was not dependent on MY desire to stop, or My belief in myself, it was never about ME in the first place. I loved your story. Just a little thing in the grand scheme of things, but not to the Lord. We are that precious to him, how awesome. It&#39;s only in the middle of darkness that I really appreciate His light.</Content>

		<Content>JMO,
I believe the answer is that God is not the only force at work in our lives.  He created us to have the ability to choose to love Him or not.  When Adam and Eve disobeyed God&#39;s desire for them in the Garden of Eden, they introduced sin and evil into a perfect world.  That dark influence is growing as more of us turn our backs on God and choose our own way, which is not really &quot;our&quot; way, but the way of fallen man.  There is sickness, death, evil, and all sorts of sins that are rampant today.  I believe we are witnessing what Jesus described in Matthew chapter 24.  We are in the midst of a spiritual battle, and our bodies are not separated from our spirits.  We suffer in our bodies the battle scars from the spiritual realm.  Hebrews chapter 11 tells us of many people who had horrible deaths in this physical world, but gained eternal resurrection life.  There is a song that I cannot remember the title of, but these words from it stick in my mind.  &quot;Sometimes He calms the storm, and sometimes He calms His child.&quot;  Our life on this earth is a battleground and we are in a war that is unseen by the physical eye.  There are hard things we will not understand until we meet God face to face.  I have held my friend as her two-year-old son was taken off life support.  I found a friend who had committed suicide.  I watched my mother-in-law die a painful death from congestive heart failure - pain that was caused because her internal organs became swollen; her feet and legs did not swell.  I believe that God loved all these people, but the suffering is the result of a fallen world.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Jane, we understand exactly what you mean. And I appreciate your post, I can see how much you care about Marissa. This is one of the things lots of people struggle with. We probably won&#39;t know why things are  so unfair or why one person will be healed and another not healed. I know in the Bible Jesus would sometimes call one from a crowd of many that were seeking healing, and heal that one. I don&#39;t know why, but at one time, I heard a Minister&#39;s theory on that, for the life of me, can&#39;t remember. It was just his theory anyways. Chemo brain rules once again. I think we have to try to believe God has a perfect plan, pray for the ability to trust Him in these matters and tell Him how hard it is to suffer thru this stuff. I finally learned to actually tell the Lord when things  felt overwhelming, too hard to do, etc. after I got on A/C. It never made the side effects go away, but mentally, I was given relief. The way I have come to terms with this type question is God never caused my cancer, that was due to many factors, and our bodies aren&#39;t perfect, our choices in life aren&#39;t perfect, and He never promised me an easy life, He just promises me that I will never be forsaken, He is with me always, even to the end. It seems like the believers and the unbelivers all suffer the same illnesses, accidents etc in this life, but the difference that our spiritual life makes is how we cope. Not saying that Christians cope any better, but I think that we may have more peace with a unfavorable outcome. So, that&#39;s what I try to cling to.  I hope I haven&#39;t offended you. I read your post and wanted to tell you that we understand and welcome what you have to say. You may not have the same opinion, but you say so in a very respectful way.  I need to remember Marissa in prayer more  and maybe I need to make a better effort to have her and the family on a prayer list at church, and in my class. Most of all, I&#39;ll pray for peace for them, that encompasses a huge number of things. God bless you Jane, and thank you for bringing this need to my attention.</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
I also have gone back to work recently... three weeks. Was concerned about returning... would have to find a new job. The medical community knew about the breast cancer and + nodes... so much for HIPPA. Previous employer had made some negative remarks publicly about my productivity during chemo...  Through this, however, I have learned a lesson... when you pray about something (a new job) and give it to God... you must leave it there!
My family doc called me to chat about a referral she made for me... I asked her to remember me when she was with physician associates in the event they were looking for a nurse practitioner. She replied, &quot;No. I don&#39;t want to do that..... I would like you to work for me!&quot; She went on to say that I was not to worry about physician appointments... just tell the receptionist when I needed time off or if I needed a &quot;down day&quot;.  Of course, I said I would like to work with her. She is one of the unique ones... interested in patient welfare rather than money.
God had put into place the job for me. I never would have inquired of her regarding an available position. The staff are a pleasure to work with and I have been in a position to encourage others who are going through difficult health related trials.
Former patients have already found my new practice location. Received a dozen roses from a dear couple. &quot;So glad to have you back,&quot; the card read... I think I have been more blessed than anyone...
Rachel, I have a PDA filled with drug, derm, ortho, peds programs because my brain is slower. I know what drug I want but can&#39;t think if it is a XR or XL preparation... A quick look and I have the answer. I don&#39;t know if that will be of help to you in your job... but for me my &quot;pocket brain&quot; is a must have.
Yes, all of us have been changed... forever... but I am determined to use my experience as part of my testimony in how God is our healer and provider in all situations.
Blessings my friends,
Pat</Content>

		<Content>Pat, once again, God turned bad to good. What a crappy thing for your ex-employer to do! But, you know in the end, you were given a better job, better employer and it sounds like the two of you were meant for each other. How wonderful to have a MD who is more concened about patient welfare than money. And your patients are hunting you down!!!! Don&#39;t you just love it? God certainly is good, all the time. What a great post. You are always a kind soul, and I would do well to learn from you. Now, where do you buy brains that you can carry in your pocket??</Content>

So while we are in prayer for others let us remember who we pray through.

		<Content>I&#39;m so happy to have found this thread.  I haven&#39;t had time to read all 7 pages of postings, but I will.  I&#39;ve been searching the internet for &quot;Christian+women+breast+cancer&quot;
I have an incredible testimony myself, but have been too emotional to write it up.  I&#39;m going to do it and do it soon.
God bless each of you</Content>

		<Content>My oncotype test came back with a score of 13.  Anything lower than an 18 means &quot;low risk for recurrence.&quot;  I had been praying for a 12, as was my church.  (Should&#39;ve prayed for a 0!!)  Anyways, I thank Him for His mercy and grace.
Side note:  I told DH that a 13 score (instead of the 12) was God&#39;s way of letting me know that the Lord is still in control.</Content>

		<Content>I read an article in a Christian Magazine about what to do with a crisis, especially if it effects your children. The first thing on the list is prayer. There have been times in my life where my prayer life was weak, I can tell when I am not where I should be in my prayer life. I tend to hold on to things that are not mine. I try to take on God&#39;s job and worry.
A great pastor once told me my job was to live with whatever my journey was, God&#39;s job was to take my burdens and keep them for me. Many a time I would find myself trying to get my burdens back from God. Now I know he is the I AM, and I am just a mere mortal. He can handle the stress, I have better things to do with my time.
Once I pray for something I feel this tremendous release, like God has said &quot;sure I get it&quot;.
Anyway I think I am writing this more for me, than for anyone else. Just because of late, trusting him is easier than ever.
It is a peace that passes understanding.</Content>

		<Content>This is a favorite verse of mine especially when I feel down or tired or tested:
Isaiah 40:31
31Yet those who wait for the LORD
Will (BL)gain new strength;
They will (BM)mount up with wings like eagles,
They will run and not get tired,
They will walk and not become weary.
So today I will not be tired or weary!</Content>

It is 10 PM here, I just came from a meeting then out to wrap up the goats. I am usually in bed much earlier!
I am letting God lead me to tomorrow&#39;s verse, be praying he will show me something that speaks to both of us!</Content>

		<Content>I have withdrawn a bit from posting... multiple issues that sort of sap one&#39;s emotional strength. When I read posts from our sisters that have relocated to their permanent residence, I feel a bit sad but I know that that is not what they or I would want. We need to continue loving one another as Christ loves each of us.
A dear friend of ours was being treated for lung cancer with mets when I was going through chemo. He and his wife would sit with me and my husband every Sunday. No one EVER joined us in the pew. Three bald heads I guess was the limit (my husband is naturally hair challenged). We used to laugh and call our pew the cancer pew. He died the day after Thanksgiving and at his memorial service his widow gave everyone a clear Christmas ornament with a picture of him with a great big smile and hair. It is what he would have wanted.
Just went to the funeral of my husband&#39;s aunt who died from BC. Lovely, southern lady. We walked into the parlor to view her and there she was... looking smashing in her gorgeous pink negligee! Again, we chuckled and remembered the joyous events that we were privileged to share with her.
We are at our temporary residence and along the way we are gifted with the friendship of those, like us, who are passing through this world into the next. We need to forgive more, love more and always be thankful.
Love ya&#39;ll,
Pat</Content>

		<Content>I came across this thread and it is such an inspiration. I am getting ready to do my 2nd chemo Fri. and my hair has really started coming out today and I felt a little low. I know God is with me each step because he promises to never leave us. When I first found out I asked why me... immediately the answer came to me.... why not? I mean there are people who have cancer who need to know Him too and I believe God uses each of us in special ways. I felt like he was telling me to follow him and he would take care of all of it. Since that time he has placed me in some unique places and I hope I have been an inspiration to others. I know others have been to me. Last week I dreamed all night that my hair was falling out and I woke up every so often feeling to see if it was still there. Talk about waking up in a bad mood! I was trying to have a real pity-party but God would not allow it. Later that morning I received a card from a co-worker. In my job I deal with people state-wide and in this card this person told me that even though he had not met me personally he felt that we have known each other all his life. He went on to state that my voice was such a comfort and each of them knew that they were safe when I was on the job. Talk about getting smacked between the eyes LOL. God let me know right quick my hair did not define who I was but what others saw did. So here I am on this journey with God and it is a trip I will never forget
God Bless each of you. You are in my prayers as we go through this together and do His will.</Content>

		<Content>His will for us is amazing to me. I never considered myself being able to help anyone, other than my children. It always seemed there was a better example a more experienced person to aid someone along. In my heart I know that God see how we respond to the challenge, he gives us the tools and the choices. The true character shows in what we do with them here on earth. Kathy walks in halls of jewels, singing every day. There is no more greater place to be, and I know that is our calling to first serve here on earth and then enjoy our fruits.</Content>

		<Content>I have been struggling again with why
bad things happen to good people. I was angry with God
for alot of years after I lost 2 children. I have struggled to
understand why some are healed while others are not.
When dear Lu passed these old feelings resurfaced. I may never truly
understand. I found this this morning and I hope it is okay that I bought it up
again.  It has helped me in my search for understanding.
bluekitten            03/11/05 02:30
I believe the answer is that God is not the only force at work in our lives. He created us to have the ability to choose to love Him or not. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God&#39;s desire for them in the Garden of Eden, they introduced sin and evil into a perfect world. That dark influence is growing as more of us turn our backs on God and choose our own way, which is not really &quot;our&quot; way, but the way of fallen man. There is sickness, death, evil, and all sorts of sins that are rampant today. I believe we are witnessing what Jesus described in Matthew chapter 24. We are in the midst of a spiritual battle, and our bodies are not separated from our spirits. We suffer in our bodies the battle scars from the spiritual realm. Hebrews chapter 11 tells us of many people who had horrible deaths in this physical world, but gained eternal resurrection life. There is a song that I cannot remember the title of, but these words from it stick in my mind. &quot;Sometimes He calms the storm, and sometimes He calms His child.&quot; Our life on this earth is a battleground and we are in a war that is unseen by the physical eye. There are hard things we will not understand until we meet God face to face. I have held my friend as her two-year-old son was taken off life support. I found a friend who had committed suicide. I watched my mother-in-law die a painful death from congestive heart failure - pain that was caused because her internal organs became swollen; her feet and legs did not swell. I believe that God loved all these people, but the suffering is the result of a fallen world.
God bless your day!

		<Content>I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re going through a hard time at the moment Carrie.  But it is understandable.  At times when we lose someone to something &quot;senseless&quot;, whether it be breast cancer or heart disease, whatever the cause, when something as recent as LuAnn&#39;s untimely passing happens, it revives old memories of past losses and the grief that we carry with us for those we have lost in the past.  Their memories are always with us, but the grief never leaves just because of the passage of time.  We just learn to live with it, we find a place to keep it, and every now and then I feel we need to tend it.  When I lost my first baby I thought the world would end.  When I lost my mother I thought it couldn&#39;t be worse.  Only to lose my younger sister 2 years later and my father that same year.  I spent a great deal of time asking &quot;why&quot; ... why did this happen.  Why did it keep happening to me.  And I realized there is no answer.  The &quot;mystery&quot; of life.  Some things we aren&#39;t meant to know on this earth.  And when I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, it was another blow.  And at that point I knew that logic didn&#39;t exist.  And for someone who spent her life from the time she could speak, asking the world &quot;why&quot;, I knew for sure that I would never ask &quot;why&quot; again.  I found some peace with knowing I never needed to ask that again.
This passage that you&#39;ve brought forward that was originally posted by Kathy is wonderful.  It speaks so well to how I feel.  Thank you for bringing this forward today.
Bless you, I&#39;ll be thinking of you all day and keep you in my prayers that your heart finds some lightness as the days pass.</Content>

		<Content>That was typical Kathy, she saw the sunny side no matter what pain was here on earth. I was heard a sermon on choosing contentment. I have been thinking so much about that idea lately. The same preacher also spoke on choosing forgiveness. That forgiveness is a choioe, contentment is a choice. Happiness is a fleeting idea, but contentment is being content where you are with what you have that God has given you. That to me was Kathy, no matter what happened she was content. That is my goal, not worldly wealth but contentment.
Carrie and Sherry your pain is a pain I do not know first hand, all I can do is say I love and I imagine your pain is indescribable.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you Cowgirl ~ pain comes and pain goes.  And I think each and every one of us experiences it at some time in our lives.
Since starting the bc journey I&#39;ve learned so much about life, so much about acceptance and how to live my life to the fullest, or as Joel Osteen says, &quot;life your best life now&quot;.  Now is the only time we have.
And I agree with you about choice ~ it is our choice how we think about things, what we choose to think about.  Patti posted a &quot;mantra&quot; last week that I love &amp;amp; I&#39;m probably paraphrasing, but it was &quot;what we think is what we put in our head.  Make sure it&#39;s something good&quot;.  Amen!!
I wanted to find contentment for years and I kept thinking it was elusive and I might never find it.  But I have.  Something as ugly as breast cancer happened in my life and it lead me to contentment.  I still have my moments when I&#39;m looking for something more or wishing/hoping/wanting something else and I stop and remind myself that where I am right now,what I have, what I&#39;m doing is quite good and if I start each day with that in mind, I feel I&#39;ve made that new start to get me going.
We&#39;ve learned so much from those who have been on this path ahead of us.  What I wish and pray for all the time is that those who are stuck in denial, or anger or bitterness can move outside &amp;amp; beyond that to a whole and content existence.</Content>

		<Content>Hi ladies,
I have missed you!  I haven&#39;t posted here as much lately.  It seems that I just don&#39;t have as much computer time with the kids being out of school and all.
Cowgirl, I was so pleased to &quot;see&quot; you in Fumi&#39;s tribute to Diane, and you, too, Carrie.  It helps so much to put faces with names.
In reading Kathy&#39;s post, quoted by Carrie, she said, &quot;Sometimes He calms the storm, and sometimes He calms the child.&quot;  I heard that several times throughout my bc treatment.  It&#39;s both calming and reassuring, isn&#39;t it?  God doesn&#39;t promise an &quot;easy&quot; life without trouble if we trust in Him.  In fact, He says, &quot;When troubles come,....&quot;
In the book of James, chapter 1, verses 2 thru 4, it says,
&quot;Consider it all joy, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.&quot;
I think of that joy as the contentment that you have been posting about.  A friend of mine also told me once that &quot;joy is the presence of God&quot;.  I now know what she meant by that.  Even in the midst of awful circumstances, we can choose joy!
I&#39;ve also heard the analogy of the oak tree and the poplar tree.  Supposedly, the poplar tree has a very shallow root system.  When a big storm comes (like the ones we have here in Texas), the tree is easily uprooted and can&#39;t withstand the storm.  On the other hand the oak tree is said to have a root system TWICE the size of the tree we see!  When the storm comes, it stands firmly.
I want to be that oak tree - firmly rooted in my faith while choosing joy!  My dx did not shake me - oh yes, a little, but I got right back up and said, okay what do we do next?  I felt like a soldier getting ready for battle.
One thing I told my kids, especially after 911, is that God knows the day He&#39;ll call each of us home.  It may be when we&#39;re 90 or it may be soon, but the day we go, is the day we&#39;re supposed to go.  At the very moment I&#39;m absent from this earth, I&#39;ll be in His presence.  How cool is that?  I also like to say,  &quot;It must be that my mansion is ready!&quot;
Shortly after my dx, I asked my 10 year old daughter how she was doing.  She said, &quot;Mom, I know you probably won&#39;t die from this [the bc], but if you do, I know you&#39;ll be with Jesus.&quot;  Yep, she&#39;s got it!
I don&#39;t have the answers to everything.  I don&#39;t know why bad things happen to &quot;good&quot; people, other than the fact that we do live in a fallen world. Kathy spoke of this and that&#39;s what I believe, too.   We have taken for granted most everything God has given us.
One last thing (sorry for the long rambling), but when I think about those whom I&#39;ve loved and lost, including both my parents, a baby, and a host of friends, some on these boards like Kathy, I just tell myself, &quot;their mansion must have been ready!&quot;
Hugs to you all,
Wendy</Content>

		<Content>Sherry,
I am so glad you shared about the bitterness, and choosing joy. We all still have bad days when we focus on the empty part of the cup, but if you focus on how much life God has given us we are truly blessed!
Wendy,
I am so glad to hear from you, and as usual such wonderful truth. When I would get upset with a crisis, I had a wonderful friend who would tell me that I must be a true piece of pottery that God was working on every day. At first I wanted to be something else that God didn&#39;t want to help so much, but now I truly understand her wisdom.
Every day I take a breath on this earth is a gift from God, the trials any of us have are wonderful experiences to trust him, love him, and live through faith.
I pray Contentment for all who read this thread!</Content>

		<Content>Carrie, never be sorry for a down post honey.  I think it&#39;s when we&#39;re &quot;down&quot; or as Cowgirl said, when we are looking at the cup half full, that we actually &quot;hear&quot; best.  It is at those times that we are able to allow spirit to flow best and that&#39;s when joy resurfaces.  Sometimes when we are at &quot;the top half of the glass&quot; we are so wrapped up in everything else that we can &quot;miss&quot; a message we were meant to hear.  Being quiet and still, and the &quot;gauge&quot; close to empty, that&#39;s when the message can begin to flow again.  Coming here with a down or sad post allows the rest of us to comfort and support you.  We are none of us alone and it is sometimes those who give so much who are unable to receive until they are slowed &quot;down&quot;.  And when we are down, my don&#39;t we truly appreciate the things we have to be grateful for?
Sharon, I&#39;m so glad you have found this thread and have found comfort and inspiration/strength.  Hope you&#39;ll come back and join the conversation on a regular basis.</Content>

		<Content>I found this on the web.  It&#39;s from a 13 year old girl.  she&#39;s pretty smart, huh?
Prayer
by Colleen Castle, age 13
Prayer is a constant conversation with God. Anytime you want to talk to God, during the day or at night, He is there to listen to you.
One time, a little while back, I was not balancing my prayers and not praying regularly. I found that I was only asking God for things in my  prayers and not praising or thanking Him as well. For example, I would ask God to keep everyone I knew safe that day, to heal someone, or even the classic &quot;please help me do well on my math test.&quot; I prayed usually only at meals, as most people do, at our family devotions every morning, but rarely anytime else. When I did pray, it seemed harder to concentrate on God and I thought about other things. Sometimes it would seem to me like God wasn&#39;t even listening to my prayer. Finally, through people like camp counselors, Sunday school teachers, and youth pastors and volunteers, I realized what not praying right was doing to my relationship with Jesus .
I started balancing my prayers and used a technique called ACTS. ACTS stands for Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Supplication. These should be the four parts of any prayer. Adoration means praising God, confession is confessing your sins, thanksgiving is thanking God for what He has done for you, and supplication is asking God for things. Thanksgiving is one of the points I am trying to emphasize in my own devotions and at other times, along with praise. I make sure I thank God for giving me each day and for answering my prayers from the last day. Then I would confess my sins, and praise Him. At the very end of my prayer I would ask him for things. But by the time I reached that component, only the important requests I had were asked and the rest I realized were unnecessary.
This is the way I pray, and have found that it has helped me grow in my relationship with Jesus. Prayer is very important in my everyday life because it is one of the ways I can communicate with God.</Content>

		<Content>Hi girls,
It&#39;s been way too long.  I&#39;m just incredibly busy with kids, band, soccer, and now hockey, school projects, and church activities.  That&#39;s a good thing, right?
I just want to thank you for your posts.  This was the first thread I came to today, and God has a way of encouraging me through your words.  Debby &amp;amp; Susan, thank you for your faithfulness to keep this thread going.  Thank you for being &quot;vessels of honor&quot; through which God can pour out his blessings!
&quot;Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.&quot;
Ephesians 3:20-21
With love,
Wendy</Content>

		<Content>James 5:13-16 (New International Version)

The Prayer of Faith
13 Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise. 14 Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. 16 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.</Content>

		<Content>For you Susan with love,
The sun can rise and shine brightly without your consent.
The waves send water to fall upon the mountains.
Flowers and weeds emerge out of the most minuscule seeds.
The moon always travels across the sky, seen or not.
Snow melts and freezes into ice, then melts some more.
Baby birds open their mouths wide for worms.
If all this can happen without your approval
What would happen if you loosened your grip?
Let down your hair?
Spoke no words, but listened intently?
Janice Stephens
hugs,
Carrie</Content>

		<Content>The Bible teaches that Satan tries to build strongholds in our lives.  One way to identify the strongholds in your life is to watch for repetative situations that pull you down in spirit.  We all know inside when something is not right in our life or is getting out of control.  If that happens to you, seek God early to find out what is going on.
Starting your day right - Joyce Meyer
This probably sounds trivial but I am really having trouble with my eating habits.  I could go every day and not eat any healthy food and just eat junk.  It wouldn&#39;t bother me a bit.  Of course, I would start feeling sick after a while and I wouldn&#39;t know why.
I guess there is something here that I don&#39;t want to face.  Don&#39;t want to do.  A comittment I don&#39;t want to make.  Self-control I don&#39;t want to exercise.
The Lord created me and knows my faults.  Why do I have such a hard time with them??

		<Content>The Angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and he delivers them.
Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him.
Fear the Lord, you his saints, for those who fear him lack nothing
Psalm 34:7-9 NIV
When King Jehoshaphat prepared for battle, (2 Chronicles 20: 15-18) he took the position of getting on his face to worship God. If you have battles to face, get in the position of warfare, and just worship the Lord.  God&#39;s response to King Jehospaphat (and us) is, &quot;Be not afraid or dismayed at this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God&#39;s.

		<Content>Luke 12:22-34 (NIV)
22 Then Jesus said to his disciples: &quot;Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. 23 Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. 24 Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! 25 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? 26 Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?
27 &quot;Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 28 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! 29 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. 30 For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. 31 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.
32 &quot;Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</Content>

		<Content>A Bible study from my pastor:
Do you ever feel like nothing is going your way? :&amp;gt;)       Do you ever feel like nothing has gone your way for years?
If you or anyone you know has / is feeling like this; today&#39;s study from Luke will probably be a great blessing for you.
Luke 13:10-17 Jesus Frees A Woman From Satan?s Grip
(Updated: 12.06.06)
To view previous Bible studies from this book; you can go on line to
&amp;amp;#9786;.
Luke 13:10-17 (NIV)
10 On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, 11 and a woman was there who had been crippled by
a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. 12 When Jesus saw her, he called her
forward and said to her, &quot;Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.&quot; 13 Then he put his hands on her, and
immediately she straightened up and praised God.
14 Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, &quot;There are six days
for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.&quot;
15 The Lord answered him, &quot;You hypocrites! Doesn&#39;t each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the
stall and lead it out to give it water? 16 Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept
bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?&quot;
17 When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things
he was doing.
Vs. 11
?? a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years??
This woman can be a metaphor for Christ?s bride; the church (then and today).
-Christ draws His bride to Him through the extravagance of His love.
-What earthly bride would not be impressed with a lover who could heal her? &amp;amp;#9786;
-His love is not one just of flowery words; but one of concrete action &amp;amp;#9786;
-Like a true lover; Christ will throw aside all convention and accepted practice to come to her aid.
-He will not let man made tradition get in the way of expressing His love to her.
-This woman is a true believer; she is in church even after 18 years of not being healed. &amp;amp;#9786;
-The true believer continues the walk of faith, regardless of their circumstances.
-Satan may be able to cripple a believer but he can never control a believer!! &amp;amp;#9786;
-We may have to go through a season of hobbling along; when we wish we could be running.
*But even if it takes 18 long hard years; in the end, Satan is always going to loose!! &amp;amp;#9786;
-It is true that living in a fallen world hurts the righteous and the unrighteous alike; but the
advantage of being counted among the righteous, is that while we walk in this world; we can call upon the Creator of
this world, by Name; because we have been adopted into His family!! &amp;amp;#9786;.
In the original language; this verse literally says, ?? a spirit of infirmity took a woman for 18 years??
-This part of Luke 13:11 is practically identical in sentence structure to John 19:1; which says, ?Pilate
took Jesus and had Him flogged.?
-The devil, his fallen angels and his human underlings are all very real &amp;amp; very wicked.
-Medicine &amp;amp; psychotherapy have their place; but only Jesus can heal/free His bride (and He has &amp;amp;#9786;).</Content>

Bring us, O Lord God, at our last awakening,
into the house and gate of heaven,
to enter into that gate, and dwell in that house where there shall be
no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light;

		<Content>From Proverbs 31 ministy devotion Lysa TerKuerst - found it appropriate for here:
 Breathe in every moment of your day today. Recognize what a gift today is. Grab someone you love and let your embrace linger just a moment longer. Take mental pictures of the toothless grin of your baby, the tousled hair of your toddler, the crooked smile of your teenager. Hold your husband&#39;s hand. Look past the dirty dishes in the sink, the laundry piled high, the stuff the kids left out and see the beauty entangled in all this evidence of life. And thank God for it all. Right now, in this second, see the blessing.</Content>

		<Content>Therefore we do not lose heart.
Though outwardly we are wasting away,
yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
For our light and momentary troubles
are achieving for us an eternal glory
that far outweighs them all.
So we fix our eyes not on what is seen,
but on what is unseen.
For what is seen is temporary,
but what is unseen is eternal.
-- 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (New International Version)</Content>

		<Content>&amp;quot;Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many&amp;quot; (Hebrews 12:14,15).
 &amp;quot;Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you&amp;quot; (Ephesians 4:31,32).
 &amp;quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly&amp;quot; (I Peter 2:23).
 &amp;quot;Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing...&amp;quot; (Luke 23:34).
 &amp;quot;For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins&amp;quot; (Matthew 6:14,15).
 &amp;quot;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God&#39;s wrath, for it is written: &#39;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&#39; says the Lord. On the contrary: &#39;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.&#39; Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good&amp;quot; (Romans 12:14-21).</Content>

		<Content>Ladies,
  First of all to EWB I don&#39;t know what hole you are falling into -- but God does and I will ask that he meet your need.
 I have read most of the posts on here and skimmed over others. Today is not a good day (explain at the end of this post)
 I was especially interested in the post about why God allows some of these things to happen.
 God never promised that we would not go through tough times ( if you are a Christian you can expect them because of Satan fighting you) but God did and does promise to go through them with us! Our pastor just said the other day that --- you are either just coming out of a trial, in a trial, or headed for a trial, or you are lying. (Just a little pastoral humor)
 I don&#39;t suppose it would be wise to mention which church I attend...... but will tell you that I have been a Born Again Christian for 58 years and for over 35 of those years I taught teenage girls in Sunday School. It has been hard to find a message board that will even answer some of my post, (except for the new one for OLDER LADIES - and I find them a caring and loving bunch.)  
 ---- but ---- I thought I would get in on this one as well ---- because we Christians really need each other.
 Now, my bad day ----- Got a recall today on my 5 yr. mammogram. It was done way back on Feb. 20. They said the films are foggy - see no problems --- but need another mammo. When the tech came back in the room she said the films were ok and I could leave. I am a little anxious about that because why did it take them a week and a half to discover the films are foggy?
 Yet, I am trusting God and praying that all is well........ and somewhere in this - there is a lesson for me - just asking for prayer and wisdom to know what it is the Lord wants me to learn.
 I really hope no one comes on and tells me to just not worry! Christians are just forgiven - not perfect - and we still have to live in these imperfect bodies until Jesus comes! Remember, Job got very discouraged because he said &amp;quot;Why didn&#39;t I just die before I was born?&amp;quot; yet he sinned not.
 Christians that say they are never scared / discouraged / anxious / depressed are either fooling themselves or lying! LOL
 I speak the truth in LOVE -- Are there any more of you like me out there?
 God bless all!

 I am so sorry to hear about foggy films. I pray it all comes out ok.
 Right now I am so scared, anxious and discouraged. And I don&#39;t know why, and I think thats is what I am finding most scary.</Content>

		<Content>Thanks Kathy for your support. You know, I prayed the Lord would put me where I&#39;m &quot;supposed&quot; to be at work, and I need to remember that, my prayers WERE answered, just not in the way I foresaw. LOL Gotta remember we don&#39;t have the answers anyways. Hope everyone one has a great weekend.</Content>

		<Content>Roxwooood, what part of VA are you from. The Lord loves us redneck christians as much as any other.
I enjoyed the verses as well as the poem . I will continue to pray for my &quot;sisters&quot;. It is only through my faith that I am worthy of HIS love and your prayers.</Content>

		<Content>I received a pray from Robert Schuler. I am a member of his website and get daily devotionals. The one today was so appropriate:
&quot;God is going to give you a problem, and that will be your opportunity. He will give you challenges. That will be your mountain. That is God&#39;s greatest gift to you. Face your mountains instead of cutting out or coasting. You&#39;ll experience the greatest joy of life: the joy of self-esteem that comes when you know you did what you had to do.
Every time one door closes, another door opens.&quot;

		<Content>Kathy,
I home schooled my kids at different times, and for a while was part of a support group of mothers who offered their skills and taught classes.  It was fun.  I quit when my oldest two were in junior high school.  Then when my youngest was in 8th grade, we went off to Mexico.  She homeschooled there in Mexico, but what she learned most, more than her academics, was a complete different culture.  She learned confidence that did not depend upon her peer group.  She learned that she loved old people, and visited with families, made friends, and learned the language all on her own.  Now she is studying to be a nurse, and will benefit greatly from knowing another language and culture.
I&#39;d love to have you share some of your little insights about Shakespeare.  One of my daughter&#39;s favorite movies is &quot;Much Ado About Nothing.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if that has anything to do with Shakespeare, but I guess they talk about the same.  It&#39;s a cute movie.
You had your three month check-up, huh?  Well, I was suppose to have mine yesterday.  Can you believe it?  I forgot it!  I think that must be a good sign, that I&#39;m not worried about it.  I rescheduled, and it is going to be this Friday.
You said that you would like us to hold you accountable to lose weight?  Well, my suggestion is to eat more fruit and vegetables, and walk, at least a little, every day.  I think it&#39;s kind of like trying to be, um, more yielded to God, and less yielded to our own crummy character.  We get that way, not by focusing on how bad our characters are, but on how good His is.  And, by immersing ourselves into His word, &quot;eating our vegetables.&quot;  The more of those vegetables ya get, the less of the other stuff ya want.  Isn&#39;t it true?  I&#39;ve been craving oranges.  Mmmm.  They are so yummy this time of year, here, anyway.  So what vegies or fruit have you been craving, if any?
The Lord bless you, and keep you, and make his face to shine upon you - -

		<Content>Kathy,
I just read over what I had written, all about everything about us.  I forgot just how much I had shared.  And your reply was very sweet.
I want you to know that God has provided a house for us to rent, a four bedroom, so we can all live under the same roof.  (Our daughter and her kids, and us, with our handicapped boy.) This house is real nice, in a nice neighborhood, on a cul-de-sac.  It is less $ per month than we are currently paying, living in two apartments.  It has a fenced back yard and we can bring our pets back from Mexico.  (I still have to talk my hubby into that one.) I am so happy about that!  It also has a little wood stove.  Our house that we sold had a wood stove and a large fenced backyard.  I have missed that wood stove.  God is really good to have blessed us with this house.
When we went to look at it, the man showing it to us (the owner)said there were 10 applications in ahead of us, and it didn&#39;t look like we&#39;d get it.  We turned in our application on Friday evening, faxed it to him, and then on Sunday he called us.   He had called the couple that he had picked to rent the house, and there was no answer.  He left three messages.  He and his wife talked about it, and decided that if they didn&#39;t answer by 5:00 p.m. Sunday, they would call us and offer it to us.  (He had not even checked our references or credit.)  My hubby was at a prayer meeting when he called.  He doesn&#39;t always go, but I suggested that he go, and pray.  I was so happy to get that phone call!  We&#39;ll be moving Memorial Day weekend.  What a memory that will make!
How can I be worried about my three month checkup?  I see God is in so total control of my life.  It just doesn&#39;t make sense to worry about that checkup.  Thus, I forgot it.  tee hee
Anyway, rejoice with us!

		<Content>Hi, sisters,
God is our provider. Isn&#39;t He. He provides us with instant communication because He loves us and wants to hear from us. I think of prayer like a medicine. I was sharing with a patient today that we are body, soul and spirit and there are interventions for all parts of our makeup. When I did my comps, one of the questions was &quot;What is you philosophy of nursing?&quot; I had developed my own theoretical model befor the exams anticipating such a question. I replied that as a nurse, I must recognize the three aspects of humanity and assist others in achieving healing when one or more of these areas are affected. I went on to quote scripture to document my theory... if any of you have taken comps, you know that you must state the author, work and date of publication... he, he... well, I did. I passed comps. I will often write prescriptions that contain a Bible verse and explain, &quot;I don&#39;t think a pill will help you... but contemplate this and you may find your answer.&quot;
Rachel, we are needed in the trenches. There is a hurting world out there. This past week has been very unsettling... so many with psychiatric and substance abuse issues... so young and sooo lost... When I ask them if they are involved in a local church, most say, &quot;No.&quot; One young man began to cry when I asked him that question this week. I directed him to a church in his area and I pray that he will go. He lost his license and has to travel on his bike.
You are right about the bond we have because of breast cancer... I feel it with other patients that are receiving cancer treatment. They know I understand the fatigue, the aches... and I think are more likely to listen to my suggestions... you can&#39;t make anyone do anything without convincing them of the sincerity of your request.
We progress on this journey... Praise God that we know the end of the trail.

		<Content>Pat, you&#39;re so right. The bond we have with the cancer patients is unbelievable! I wonder, do they feel this bond for us, as strongly as we feel it for them? It is so hard to describe, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s just there, and it makes your heart feel so full with compassion, and love, like you&#39;ve never felt before. It&#39;s so hard for me to put into words, I know you understand tho. It&#39;s a blessing to be back at work now, and I hope we never lose this bond we feel for oncology patients. It&#39;s truly a blessing to be able to feel so deeply, it&#39;s so intense, and we know we&#39;re alive! I remember when I had severe depression in my 20&#39;s, I felt nothing, like a vaccum had come in and sucked all emotion from me, no anger, no joy, no happiness, fear, absolutely nothing. It was such a horrible feeling. Now, I am abundantly blessed with emotions, some good, some not so good (like my menopausal irritatibliity) LOL Life is good. I was at Springfest in P&#39;cola last night, before work, and I realized that during chemo, all I could think was &quot;I hope I don&#39;t have to wear a bandanna to Springfest this year. I hope my hair has grown out enough by then to go bare headed. It&#39;s just so hot this time of year, being outside all day with my head covered seemed unbearably hot&quot; well, sitting there listening to Cheap Trick, I realized I had lost my bandanna exactly 2 months ago! and I&#39;ve dyed my hair again, recently! Life is good, God is good, that&#39;s for sure. I know it seems ridiculous, but just knowing how much I longed for the spring to come, and to be able to go to Springfest this year, maybe appearing normal again, that was a my goal, my dream and to realize I had far exceeded it, OMG how wonderful! truly wonderful. And the fact that I went in and was able to work 8 hours afterwards, who would have dreamed it? Not me, for sure. Now, I&#39;ll be stiff, sore, cranky and tired, bloated and whiney when I get up this evening. LOL But right now, coming in from work, all I can say is life is good, and thank you Lord for wading thru this with me. Your grace has seen me thru so much.</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
I am sooo happy you had a great time. I spent this weekend with our son in Tallahassee. Just 13 months ago he called me unexpectedly late one night (the day I was diagnosed... was going to wait until the weekend to tell him and his sister)... anyway... when I answered the phone he asked, &quot;Mom, are you OK?&quot; I was taken by surprise and had to tell him in a disjointed fashion that I had breast cancer. He cried and cried and finally said that he was calling the campus minister to pray with him.
The year has passed and I am also back to work... the weather was gorgeous and though we spent Saturday getting groceries and doing laundry... we were together and I was well again! We capped off the day with the new Star Wars movie and then went to church today... I enjoyed so much being in his presence and remembering that I was advised to abort him 21 years ago because of heavy bleeding but refused and sought another opinion. What miracles God performs when we trust in Him!

		<Content>Carol,
Congratulations on the house; sounds wonderful and perfect for your family.  I always look for a house with a yard for kids to play.  We live in a very good neighborhood for walking and bike riding.
&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; IS Shakespeare! Ha!  My daughters love it, too.  That is usually what I start with in class.  We do some history of the Globe theater, the customs and traditions of the times, and the beliefs of the people.  I have them write a sonnet and we talk about ballads, too.  Then, we watch &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;; followed by reading it in parts.  Over the years, we have done MacBeth, Hamlet, King Lear, A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, A Comedy of Errors, Merchant of Venice, and Taming of the Shrew.  The kids really do enjoy the class for the most part.  I had one girl that got an attitude, but my percentage is still good.  Our public library has a 1936 version of A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream with Mickey Rooney playing Puck.  He was a kid and it is really a good production, black and white, but good considering the technology of the time.  The newer movie of Hamlet is good, too.  The Taming of the Shrew with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor is classic; so much like their real-life story I think.
As for the weight thing, I know all the facts about food, it is just a matter of putting too much in my mouth.  I need to practice more self-control.  I just need people to ask me now and then if I am staying on track or indulging.  I don&#39;t know if you have heard about the Weigh Down Workshop, but the founder, Gwen Shamblin, got to the real problem of overeating.  She tromped on my toes, but she says that we make food an idol.  I do that in so many ways  - comfort, feeling that it is so important that I cannot waste it, and indulging in the sensual side of food.  Anyway, I try to not eat unless I&#39;m truly hungry and eat moderately.  I also try to work out three times a week at the gym.  I was going to do that this morning, but scheduling things got in the way and I&#39;m using my gym time to hang out on the boards.
How was your check-up?  I go to the PT today to get measured for another LE sleeve.  It is getting hot here and I&#39;m trying to stay cool.  It was 99 on Saturday and 101 yesterday; that&#39;s hot for May in Texas.  It usually doesn&#39;t get to 100 until June, then it stays that way until September.
Where do you live?  You mention Mexico, so I am guessing that you must live somewhat close to the border.
Rachel and Pat,
I am a nurse and reading your posts makes me want to jump back into work.  I am currently home-schooling my two kids 16 and 14, so I can&#39;t do that right now, but I am making plans for the next few years.  I could probably do part time in a couple of years.  I might need to do that for college at that point, too.  So far we&#39;ve only had to pay for college for one at a time, but these last two are closer together.  My oldest has just graduated from nursing school and is moving to Lubbock to work in a level I trauma ER.  She moves in June 3rd and starts work the 6th.  My son is getting a job with an ambulance service; he is an intermediate EMT and trying to get into medical school.  Please pray for him that he will be yielded to God and obedient to His calling.  I think that God has called him to be a medical missionary, but he has to know that.  I can&#39;t tell him what God has for him; he has to hear God for himself.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Kathy,
When you do return to nursing, you will be such a blessing to your patients! I saw a new patient today with a BC history and she was able to communicate her fears and expressed her thanks to God that He arranged the appointment with me... she didn&#39;t know my history before coming to our office. The doc saw her husband and I saw her. We shared how this whole trial has made our faith stronger and rearranged priorities. We must daily lift up our children that they will hear the call of God in their lives. I pray this everyday.
Be blessed this week!

		<Content>Pat, what a bittersweet memory, 13 months ago. And what a wonderful testimony you have, in so many ways. Imagine, being told to abort him, cuz he wouldn&#39;t have made it etc. Little do they/we know. God is certainly good.
Kathy, are you thinking of doing oncology when you go back to work? I bet you would love it so much that you&#39;d do it for free (better not tell them, they&#39;d try it)Between your spiritual and physical witness to those patients, they would surely be blessed. Thanks again for the lovely reply during my frenzy yesterday morning. I am soo soo sooo glad that I tore up those pages of hurtful words. Imagine, the devil telling my pride that if I tore them up it meant I was afraid of confrontation! Don&#39;t he know me well??? LOL I am gonna look up that part of Peter and see what it says, bet I can guess. Is it about how dangerous our tongue can be??? My son and I have had that conversation so many times, and bless his soul, he has the same issues  that his father and I had. Luckily, he isn&#39;t violent, and hopefully will never be. He was mortified when I signed him up for football. He just couldn&#39;t come to terms with hurting someone, and he&#39;s basically that way today. He is like 5ft 9 inches now, and not 13 yet.
I love the show The Contender, and asked him about boxing someday, and same answer, &quot;no Mom, I just can&#39;t hurt anybody&quot;. So, he may have inherited our flaws, he also inherited out big hearts. LOL Okay, going to bed. Had a great night at work, I am blessed beyond belief, just have amnesia about it sometimes. Nite.</Content>

		<Content>Kathy,
Thanks for the &quot;congrats&quot;.  I was wondering where you were.  We will be beginning our move this &quot;Memorial Day&quot; weekend.  It will be a memory maker.  I am going to be so glad to put this little apartment behind me.  It screams of cancer treatment memories!
I am going to rent some of those movies and watch them.  I&#39;ll be talking with you about them.
The weight thing - I have a friend, a very, very dear lady who does that with food.  She really does idolize it.  She is such a caring person, and I think really doesn&#39;t get enough TLC for herself.  Always giving.  I think food is just her subconscious way of getting something back, or something.  It is very hard for her.  I&#39;m encouraging her, and asking her how she is doing at least a couple of times a week, and it is helping her get motivated.

Kathy, get out and walk, EVERY DAY, two times a day.  I started gaining weight, I think because of the Arimidex.  Just a few pounds, but I&#39;m not eating much, not enough to cause weight gain.  So, I figure that if I walk, more and more, then I probably won&#39;t gain weight, might even lose a little.  If I walk even more, then I can eat more.  Yes!!!!  I like that idea.  Also, I want to do my part to win the battle against breast cancer, and exercise is on the list.
Plus, you know, though I was a missionary, and still am, I am so very imperfect.  Funny, I say I was a missionary and people get this idea formed in their heads that I&#39;m, uh, just, I don&#39;t know, just different than who I am.  I have so many faults and imperfections, my tongue being my worst enemy.  So, anyway, I have prayed and begged God to help me with this, and I have found that walking really helps.  It&#39;s a self control thing, I guess.  And when I feel frustrated, I walk.  I talk to God about what&#39;s bothering me.  This morning I took a paper on which I had printed up Psalm 34, and worked on memorizing it as I walked, which wasn&#39;t difficult because the first 4 verses I already know as a song.  It struck me this morning, saying that verse over and over, &quot;I will extol the Lord; his praise will awlays be on my lips.&quot;  Well, I thought, if indeed I make it my intent for His praise to always be on my lips, then other it will be impossible for other words to be there too.  Make sense?

Anyway, sorry for rambling.  I didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night.

I have my first PT appointment this morning, actually in another hour, so I gotta get off this board, huh?  I&#39;m gonna have to hurry, I see.

Anyway, I live in Salem, Oregon.  Not close to the border at all.  It takes us about 48 hours of driving time to get to our place in Mexico.  Where we will be going next month.

Well, best go.  Got lots more to share.  About what we might be doing here, now that we&#39;re not going to be going to be living in Mexico full time.

Well, just let me say - we had a board meeting the other day for our non-profit organization that we have, and discussed our possible options for ministry here.  We are going to keep involved in our church, my husband leads worship, and he&#39;s going to be starting a Sunday night service, teaching through the book of Luke.  I&#39;m going to be taking over the children&#39;s ministry there.  (Aren&#39;t many kids now, but watch out, it&#39;ll grow.  I love kids, and love teaching them, and involving myself in their lives, soccer games, etc.  That&#39;s what it takes, love.)  And then, we&#39;re going to get involved in the Union Gospel Mission here, and also I&#39;m considering mentoring ladies in the women&#39;s prison, at least I&#39;ll be visiting one lady, a friend of a friend of mine, who is in there for 6 months.  I want to test the waters in many areas, and see what works.  I&#39;m just not afraid of people, and love them, and so want to test different areas.  I&#39;ve always wondered about visiting people in prison.  I have a friend, a nurse, who works in the ladies prison.
Anyway, and then, I have been involved with a place here, where we get help for our handicapped boy, and they like me there and are encouraging me to start up a support group here in Salem.  There is nothing, nothing, nothing for parents of handicapped children to connect with each other, no support system at all.  So, I am going to research and see what I can do.  Maybe I can help, maybe not.
I&#39;m just open to letting God stretch me, and use me, however He will.  His strength is mine, he can equip me to do His will, to help people, to love people.  To point them to Him.
Well, gotta rush.
I&#39;m so glad to hear from you.  Thought I&#39;d lost ya.
Please, go for a walk today.  I will check up on you and ask you.  Don&#39;t worry about the food.  Just WALK.  K?

		<Content>Carol, Rachel, and Pat,
I did 2.25 miles in thirty minutes today on the elliptical trainer and did arm weights, too.  I have really been working on getting my pulse back in the sixties as a resting heart rate.  It was in the nineties post chemo and that really bothered me.  It has always been in the sixties as far back as I can remember.  Heart disease is the thing that runs in our family and I do not want to do anything that will cause problems.
If you are renting movies, Enchanted April is a good one, too.  It appeals to older audiences that have experienced some of life beyond the teen years.  We watched Napoleon Dynamite the other day just to see what the kids were quoting all the time.  It is so stupid that it is funny.  I would not recommend it as &quot;good&quot; movie; just the result of some kids making their own movie and it grew into this production.  The kids love it, though.
There are so many ministry opportunities available.  I can see why it would have been a temptation for Jesus to take the whole earth and make it work the way it was intended to instead of listening to His father and dying for all of us instead.  I have to be careful to hear God telling me the things He wants me to be involved in because Kathy wants to fix things and get them going.  We currently have a woman living with us and we are trying to get her to the point of seeing what God would have her do with her life.  She is a believer and has been hurt, but tries to stay in the past instead of moving on.  We have a small group that meets at our house on Sunday night for a simple meal, sometimes Bible study and encouragement, but always spend time in prayer.  My husband alternates with another man teaching our Sunday school class.  We have an open home where a lot of casual ministry takes place.  We try to make this our way of life instead of having a compartmentalized life.
I can so relate to the tongue thing.  We tried a home church group for a couple of years or so and I did not do well with that.  I seemed to be in conflict with the leaders almost constantly.  I do not consider myself to be a contentious person, but I will not tolerate what I believe to be wrong.  My husband wanted to do this and I tried to be submissive and go along.  However, I went kicking and screaming.  I could not buy into their view of this group being the &quot;true church&quot; and others just did not &quot;get it&quot; like they did.  It was a very arrogant and elitist attitude from my perspective and they weren&#39;t used to a woman speaking out like I did.  After we left that group and became involved in our current church, my husband came home one day and said he found a book he thought I could relate to - Redefining the Strong-Willed Woman!  It is by Cynthia Tobias and it is very good.  It helped me understand me.  I found out why I could offend someone and not mean to at all.
Anyway, I&#39;ve got to take my daughter to piano.  Enough rambling for now.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Hey, I&#39;ve seen that movie &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; with my husband, daughter, and pastor (who is an old time friend, for 35 years).  I felt sorry for the guy, so wasn&#39;t as humored by it.  What I did find humorous was watching all of them laugh so hard at everything.  Now, that was funny!  I&#39;ll have to check that book out.  Thanks for sharing.  I had a good pt visit.  I posted about it.  I&#39;m glad you are walking.  Keep up the good work. My pulse was high through chemo, too, and was high before, too, but not as bad.  Maybe the walking will help?  I hope so.
Yeah, I could just get involved and more involved in things, without knowing for sure which way to go.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m just testing the waters at this point, and asking people to pray, and praying, that God will guide and equip us, and help us know for sure what He has for us.  It&#39;s good that you are so involved in sharing your lives.  Be careful with the lady living with you.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine, but, that&#39;s what happened with our daughter.  Shared her home with her best friend who needed help, and her two children, and poof, her husband fell, and now they are divorced.  We thought it would be no problem, and were in favor of helping her.  It is not wise, though.  None of us ever thought anything like that would happen, or could happen, to them.  They were very happily married.  So we thought.  Don&#39;t be weird, or anything, but do be wise.  K?  I hate saying that.  But, oh well, you know where I&#39;m coming from.
Got to let my hubby have this computer now.
Woops.  Went passed my time.
TTYL

		<Content>I really enjoy reading everyone&#39;s posts. I so look forward to what you all say, it is so helpful to me. Just wanted to tell you, I&#39;ve found if I don&#39;t say something when I feel it, the moment passes, and well...how can that person ever know what impact they are making on my life? Course, saying something when I feel it kinda backfires when you&#39;re really upset!!! LOL Carol, walking, as self control, influencing our tongues seems like a great idea. I will have to try it, and SOON TOO!
Has anyone ever thought about how women seem to have such a hard time with their tongues, even more so then men? I don&#39;t want to sound terrible, but I&#39;ve talked to my husband about this many times. It seems like we are bascially the trouble makers of this world, we seem to be tempted to gossip more than men, we are definitely much more difficult to work with in the work place than men (I don&#39;t believe hormones are the reason), etc etc. I&#39;ve noticed it time and again, our tongues and temptation to brew trouble ...I tend to think that it&#39;s related to Eve, the trouble she brewed up in the Garden of Eden, became tempted by satan, and talked Adam into giving in to temptation too. (I don&#39;t mean Adam wasn&#39;t responsible for what he did, he made the choice, please don&#39;t misunderstand what I mean). You know how the Bible talks about women suffering when in childbirth? something along those lines? I wonder if our tendancies and temptations are related back to Eve? I hope this made some sense, and didn&#39;t sound insane. LOL I tend to get stuff confused from the Bible, and never remember the exact phrases or where it came from. I would never mean to imply that we are doomed to repeat Eve&#39;s mistakes, or that it&#39;s a curse. I guess what I mean is that we will struggle with these issues as a result of her actions.
Anyways, gotta get back to work. Will look forward to the next posts from you all, they are so uplifting and full of information. God bless each of you.</Content>

		<Content>Hi there, Rachel.  Glad you could identify with me, and my tongue.  I understand what you mean about Eve.  You are right, in a way.  But you know what, it really was the devil who was the one behind the whole thing, tempting her.  She was the first to sin, for sure, though, and then man.  The Bible says somewhere that woman is the weaker.  However, they did both choose.  Oh, where is that?  I could find it.  The Bible says that Eve was deceived, and so she was punished for her sin.  But, it says that Adam sinned with his eyes wide open, knowing exactly what he was doing, intending to do it.  He was even more accountable for what he did than she was.  If you&#39;re interested I can find that for you.  Anyway, because of them we all are born with sinful natures, even a little child, you can see that selfish nature in them.  Me first!  Listen to me!  It&#39;s just human nature.  We all have it.  That&#39;s why we need a redeemer, a perfect redeemer, and that&#39;s why none of us can be that redeemer.  The only one born without that sinful nature was Jesus, (as well as that He chose to never sin, was always perfect) whose father is God, and who is himself God.  That&#39;s why He could pay the price, the penalty for our sin - because He was and is perfect, holy, the perfect lamb of God.  Isn&#39;t that great?

I don&#39;t know about you, but this cancer garbage has made me feel like a horrible sinner, which I am.  After my surgery, when I thought I was going to die any day, I was scared to death (oh, what a play on words!).  I was so scared, thought that death would just be dark, emptiness.  Scared, even though a month before that, and all my life, I had such faith in God, and trust in Him.
Anyway, I was scared, too, of, well, that I wouldn&#39;t be accepted by God, because of how grumpy and, well, it&#39;s a bad word, but, the b word, you know b - i - t __  __ y.
Rrrr.  Funny.  I don&#39;t swear, you know, too good for that.
Confession is, that when I get upset, with my dear hubby (who can really pull my strings, and I his) I let come out of my mouth quite a flow of such words.  Ohh, how I don&#39;t want that, but how it still happens.  Just does.
I have felt, how on earth, dear God, can You continue to forgive this horrible habit I have, of blurting out such garbage, when I&#39;m upset, or hurt?  How?
Then, after treatment sometime, it occurred to me to look at Jesus.  He, upon the cross, with what upon Him?  Awwww, yes, my SIN.  That was right up there with Him.  He took it upon Him.  So now when I think about my sin, which I feel like the worst sinner in the world when I let myself yield to my mouth, I try to get a grip, and look at that sin, up there with Him, and ask Him to forgive me and think about that, and know that this is what He died for.
And yes, I&#39;ve asked Him to help me get a grip on this bad quality of my personality.  He didn&#39;t just pay the price for me, so I could just keep on in that, but so that I would be free from it.  And I want to be free from that.  I want that more than anything.  I do not want to go the rest of my life giving in to that.  I want to be done with that.
Now how is that for a TRUE CONFESSION.  No, it&#39;s not some horrible thing, like adultery, or murder, or pornography, or drugs, or whatever.  But, somehow, it sure made me feel like just the worst sinner in the world.  Totally unacceptible, unforgiveable.  I would never tell anyone else that they were the worst sinner in the world for that, if they told me this.  But, for me, I just felt HORRIBLE!
This walking has really helped me.  When I feel a stressful situation about to occur, if possible, I sneak away and walk.  It is so good!  And pray, or sing, or just listen to whatever I hear.  I feel so good, like maybe I&#39;m on to something.  Maybe I&#39;m going to get a grip on this.  I really and truly PRAISE GOD for this hope.  He is so good, isn&#39;t He?

And the verse came to my mind (don&#39;t know where it&#39;s found - should, but don&#39;t) &quot;If it be possible, as much as lieth within you (garsh, King James Version is stuck in my memory) live peaceably with all men.  (IF IT BE POSSIBLE) Guess that includes my hubby, huh?  He&#39;s the only person I&#39;ve ever in my life talked to like I do, swearing and stuff.  The ones we love the most, they are the ones we are most vulnerable to show our worst side, isn&#39;t it true?  I get so sensitive, and hurt so easily, and react, and then he reacts, and then, back and forth, until, those words come out.  Those horrible words!
Garsh, I feel so vulnerable sharing all this.  But, oh well.  It&#39;s probably good to make myself vulnerable.  Maybe it will help someone.  Maybe not.  But, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll pray for me, and I value that a lot.
But, whether I fail again or not, I know something now that I didn&#39;t know.  Should have.  Thought I did.  But, I didn&#39;t, not like I do now.  Thing is, I&#39;m forgiven.  Always will be.  He saw to that.  I&#39;m so glad I know that!
Let&#39;s keep encouraging each other, and building each other up.  K?

		<Content>Kathy,
My daughter said she also saw A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, but that she didn&#39;t like it, because she didn&#39;t understand the plot.  She said something about someone turning into a donkey or something.  She would like to understand the plot, and thinks she would probably like it if she understood it.  Can you help?  I think she saw a newer version of it.

		<Content>Carol, isn&#39;t it the absolute most infuriating thing when you realize what you&#39;ve said or done, and would have never ever done this under normal circumstances? My mouth is my very very worst enemy. So many times if only I stopped and thought rationally, and simply asked the Lord what He&#39;d have me do, that would be the end of it, and I&#39;d never take it a step further. My husband and I are extreme opposites and he generally is very thoughtful before he says something (maybe that&#39;s why I was livid when I read his journal the other night, it was so out of character to hear him talk or think like that). LOL Yes, one would HOPE that taught me a lesson, but ..... with me, you just never know. When I first met him  4 years ago, I did the same thing, found a journal he kept a year before I even knew him, read it, and got my feelings hurt, felt like he would never love me like he had loved the person he was writing about....Can you believe what a repeat offender I am? I told him what I did, and in a way of apology, I bought him this nice leather bound journal that I  so secretly read the other night. 4 years later, and still acting a fool.  I tell him straight out, how nosy I am, put passwords on anything like that if it&#39;s in the computer... and I really mean it, keep me out of temptation.
I didn&#39;t tell him about the other night, never brought up what I&#39;d read, and thanks to Kathy, I saw that he was a being a decent person, but not keeping his feelings stuffed inside and not venting to me, or someone in our lives, just writing it all down in there. A much safer, more mature option. Thank God for good advice and compassionate friends. Gonna get in bed, have a good day ladies.</Content>

		<Content>I got a new Leslie Sansone walking tape... 4 miles in 45 minutes and then a 15 minute toning session... very good! The media is relaying today about the 50% reduction in recurrence of BC with 30 min of exercise daily... Hmm... we are responsible for or bodies aren&#39;t we?
I gotta go... got charts to do and I want to walk tonight before it gets too late.
Be blessed sisters,

		<Content>Pat, I hadn&#39;t heard of this walking tape, but glad you recommended it. I will try to find it. I need to get going so bad. How I hope that survey is correct and the exercise will cut recurrence by 50%. That&#39;s as good as treatment! does it mean I can stop my Tamoxifen if I start walking every day?????


Oh how we wish that was the case. Walking is another opportunity to regain some control over this disease, empower ourselves. Do you think it matters if we walk that long or longer, but in shorter spurts like 10 or 15 min @ a time?</Content>

		<Content>Pat and Rachel,
Wow, Pat, 4 miles in 45 minutes is hooking it!  I am working hard to get 2 miles in 28 minutes.  I read that walking 30 minutes a day at a rate of 2 to 2.9 mph was enough.  I&#39;m pushing my heart rate into the 140&#39;s to try for more cardio fitness.  I think chemo really did a number on our bodies.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Carol,
The plot for A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream is that Theseus, the duke of Athens, is getting married.  As part of the celebration, a group of working men decide to put on a play and go into the woods to rehearse.  As a subplot, Hermia is in love with Lysander, but her father wants her to marry Demetrius.  Helena, Hermia&#39;s friend is in love with Demetrius.  This foursome are out in the woods as well, because Hermia and Lysander are running away from her father.  Puck is a mischievous little fairy imp who casts spells on people for amusement.  There is a whole host of fairies in the woods that night.  The play is convoluted, but it is such a good comedy.  I have not seen the later version.  Hope this helps.  My husband and son just came through the room while I had the Shakespeare book down to see how to spell the names for you.  They said why are you quoting Shakespeare on the breast cancer site?  My son said what does that have to do with breast cancer?  When I told my husband it was just women and we find out about each other besides breast cancer he said that was right.  He is amazed at what I can find out about people just by talking to them.  He calls me Nosey-Rosey because there is not much I will not ask, although I don&#39;t think I&#39;m rude.  There is a fine line.  Anyway, need to go to bed; I&#39;m going to chemo with a friend tomorrow and her chemo lasts six hours.
God bless your day!

		<Content>I&#39;m taking large doses of C0 Q10 to help my cardiac function. I read a few years ago that they did a study on it&#39;s effectiveness with heart failure, and there were patients on the waiting list for heart transplants, given huge doses of this, cuz they had nothing to lose, the traditional medicine wasn&#39;t winning the war being waged against their hearts. In most of the people, they saw a huge improvement, and since reading that about 8 years ago, I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s become one of the hot things to use/take. I found no side effects or risks involved with it, had taken it for a year or two back then, but it got expensive. Has either one of you heard anything like this about it? I wish I could recall the source of the study I read, it seemed pretty credible at the time. I had that mild congestive heart failure stuff on my echo, but I am still sustaining my cardiac output/function. I wish I had the report with me right now, so I could type out what it said. I believe that in time my heart will regain what it lost with chemo, if I act wisely. My ejection fraction was 59% prior to the chemo. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m in denial or what, but I just don&#39;t want to go have a PET scan, or another MUGA scan or CT scan. I want to live in faith that I&#39;m gonna be fine for years, and it seems like if I request these tests, that I am searching for &quot;proof&quot; that I am healed. Or am I just running from the possibility of having results that I simply don&#39;t want to deal with? I think the devil would have me believe that I am  weak and in denial, afraid of what the tests may reveal. It&#39;s always some kind of war going on inside us isn&#39;t it? I think until I really feel lead to do otherwise, I&#39;m gonna leave good enough alone. I prayed for my onc&#39;s wisdom, he is  a wonderful man, and I feel hand picked by God. He is pretty conservative with tests etc. and once realizing his thinking behind it, I agree.  He&#39;d order any tests that I wanted, if it &quot;would make you feel better&quot;. LOL  How much more agreeable could the man be? I love him. I can have any of these tests done where I work absolutely free (except for the radiologists reading fee) but money wasn&#39;t the issue. What is your all&#39;s thoughts on this?</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
I don&#39;t know about CO Q10, but I do know about exercising.  I have proven that to myself.  The heart is a muscle and the more workout we give it the stronger it will be, within reason, of course.  I have read Dr. Ken Cooper&#39;s books and I was faithful in running in my early 20&#39;s before I had kids.  I have had a weight problem most of my life.  I had been walking before I was diagnosed, trying to get in 2 miles in less than thirty minutes.  My knees and current weight make it hard to run very much.  I don&#39;t know if I will ever run again, but walking can give me a good workout.  Given your original ejection fraction, I think it could be improved with exercise that is consistent and moderate.  Cardio three times a week and milder forms three to four times a week would do it.  It will take a month or so for you to notice improvement, but I bet it will happen.  I just got back from the gym as I type this.  I try to let my arm cool down before showering, so it is a good time to be on the boards.  When I went to radiation, it was all I could do to walk from the parking lot to the radiation area.  I pushed myself to try to get faster everyday and it worked.  As I got in better shape and my blood counts rose, I could definitely feel the difference.  It felt good.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Kathy,
Thanks for the info.  I&#39;ll have to watch the movie now.
I think men just don&#39;t understand women.  We like to share stuff, and like to connect with other women.  Men don&#39;t much like to share all their stuff.  I mean, watch two men together, or listen them, and what do they talk about?  They talk a lot, sometimes, but not usually in regards to relationships or mistakes they&#39;ve made, but mostly about their jobs or accomplishments or something.  We always amaze them when we can know so much about each other, so quickly, without maybe even having met each other.
Anyway, I had my first day yesterday, volunteering.  I posted a little about it under &quot;moving beyond cancer&quot;.

		<Content>Rachel,
I think 15 minutes a day is better than nothing. We have to keep moving. I like the 4 mile tapes because I can always stop at any point if I need to and do the cool down. I just found out that the nurse of one of my surgeons is moving down the street and she walks 2-4 miles a day. I told her to come by and nag me to go with her. We have to keep this temple in shape.

		<Content>I was thumming through a bible of mine the other day - the bible I used when going through treatment,  I&#39;m reading in another one now.  Anyway, I came across some verses that I had underlined, dated Oct.15, 2004, and said  &quot;Started chemo. Feel horrible, burning, fear, crying out to God - I don&#39;t want to be doing this! Help!&quot; I wrote that, by these verses - - Psalm 20:1-5 Actually those verses don&#39;t ring out too much, I suppose, just reading them.  But I remember that dark moment, and how God used those verses to speak deep into my heart, and give me hope. They still do that, as I read over them again, now.  Key words in those verses- - in day of trouble - - Lord be with you - - send aid - - remember with pleasure - - grant heart&#39;s desire - - news of victory - - answer your prayers.
God is good.  He is always near to those who cry out to Him.
He hears, and answers.

		<Content>Caroltina-our diagnosises came at almost the same time-I was diagnosed on Oct 11, 2004! I also really just turned it over to the Lord. I read a great book and reread, The Red Sea Rules. It is 10 chapters, very small and explains that we are right where the Lord wants us to be and is a comparison to the Istraelites being sved by crossing the red sea. It shows that no matter how hopeless we feel the Lord will take care of us. Some days it is easier not to remember that and try to take this all on ourselves.
You were the second person yesterday to comment on Phil 4:13. I have run into that verse so many times on this journey it is unreal! Heidi</Content>

		<Content>Kathy, Carol, Pat, you have convinced me that I must make time for walking/exercise. Thanks so much, I will definitely try. I am have decided to try to drink at least a gallon of water daily too. I love water, not a problem usually, just remembering to do so. One thing about chemo, it really zaps your taste for water a while, I hated that the worst. Kathy, as you said, my heart is a muscle, it can and will become stronger with use and exercise. What a convincing statement, if ever there was one!
Just like my legs and arms, my heart can become stronger and more effective with proper use. We must take care of our temple, that&#39;s right Pat. In a way, it&#39;s not really ours to abuse anyways. LOL
The verses that sustained me during chemo was about the Lord never leaving me or forsaking me. It kept me sane. I remember once just crying out, &quot;Lord this is so hard&quot; and I lifted up my hands to Him. It was if I could feel Jesus&#39;s hand take mine, and I knew it would be ok. It&#39;s real hard to explain, but it was a turning point for me, and one of my best memories with chemo. I guess I had forgotten that I actually needed to tell Him how hard it was, duh. How we forget how much He really cares about such simple things, let alone the big ones. I&#39;m grateful to be at work and signing on this morning. Life is good.
There is someone missing from the boards that I have gotten more concerned about. I don&#39;t know that she would be comfortable with me broadcasting her name on here, but would you please remember one of our sisters in prayer? She has just dropped out of sight, even her very best friend has had no contact with her for weeks now, and that&#39;s quite unusual.</Content>

		<Content>Heidi,
Actually my diagnosis was much earlier.  I had surgery September 13.  Then started chemo October 15.  When was your surgery, and when did you start chemo?  What are your stats?  lymph nodes? etc.?  Mine are: bilateral mastectomy, grade 3 tumor, 14+ lymph nodes, 100% estrogen positive.
I will check into that book.  Sounds very good.  I love the OT.

What a story!  I shared it with my nursing student daughter.  God is truly in control!  We are so much better off when we stop trying so hard to be in control and let Him do the job.  We can enjoy what He has provided for us then.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Hi, Ladies.  I just wanted to share a recent experience with you.  When I saw my rad onc on Tuesday I mentioned a few random, vague pains that I have been having in my head.  I really didn&#39;t think too much of it since they come and go and are in different places.  WELL, she ordered a brain MRI, asap!!  I totally freaked out because I&#39;m really claustrophobic.  I mean really, really!  So she ordered an OPEN MRI.  When I got there I took one look at that machine and knew I was in trouble.  After I laid down, the tech put a mask over my face (that made me look like Freddie) and slid the machine over my head.  It was about 6&quot; from my face.  I said that I thought this was supposed to be open.  They said, &quot;Well it&#39;s open on the sides&quot;.  Anyway, I had to be in there for 30 minutes!  I spent the first part of it praying for my family and all my BC sisters and I did fine.  Then a little over half way through I began to panic.  I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and my heart started to pound in my head.  Tears started to run down my face and yet I still couldn&#39;t move.  So I pictured Jesus sitting right beside me and holding my hand very tightly.  And you know what?  I could really feel Him right there with me!  And in a split second I was calm and at peace.  It is so wonderful to have our Lord to call on!  Hope everyone is having a great day!  Oh, BTW.  I have an &quot;Unremarkable brain!&quot;  I could have TOLD them that</Content>

		<Content>Beautiful Sherri! I know too well what you mean about the &quot;open&quot; MRI?? I said the same thing, and they reassured me the open part was to the side, that tiny crack didn&#39;t do me any good either.
I have never asked for help in the way you did, but I am so happy to read what happened to you! Yes, the Lord is always there, just waiting on us to let Him inside. I will try my best to not forget your post, I know it will be useful during the many tests we will have again. BTW Congratulations on your &quot;unremarkable brain&quot;, we happen to think you&#39;re pretty remarkable tho.</Content>

		<Content>Just wanted to say, that I still am blessed with patients that I either I need, or they need me. It is such a blessing when I feel that bond, and even more of a blessing when I realize somehow I have made a difference in someones life. Tonight, I had a woman who that they discovered she had a huge brain tumor yesterday. Not sure if it&#39;s malignant, but tends to look that way. She is having a craniotomy this morning, family very scared naturally. So, when I initially went in to meet her, a lady in the room visiting her said &quot;look, she&#39;s got short hair&quot; talking about my short hair. LOL I said, well, yeah, this is my chemo hair cut. Little did I know, that one of her greatest fears was losing her hair. The family told me outside of her room later on in the shift. So, then I realized why she was my patient, so she can see, it really does come back, and it&#39;s gonna be okay. They needed to see that cancer is not a death sentence, and that life goes on! when they asked me if I was in remission, I have that dumb answer I always have &quot;well, I really think so&quot; but that God is good all time, it&#39;ll be okay either way. Little did I know what an impact that would have on her outlook. Truly God is good.  I felt such a bond with this patient and her family. We hugged and teared up this morning when saying good bye. Very unusual for me to cry.</Content>

		<Content>That&#39;s weird.  My daughter is studying to become an RN.  In one of her classes, a few weeks ago, one of her classmates told of something that he witnessed in the emergency room where he works as a CNA part time.  He told an elderly lady, maybe 65 or 70, who came in with a heart attack.  She was pronounced dead.  They cleared her bead so there was room for other patients, and put her body in another room, where they left it for a little while.  Like 5 minutes or so later a nurse walked by and noticed her move, and saw that there was a heartbeat.  So, they rushed her back into the emergency area, where she had another heart attack, and then was pronounced dead again.  Then somehow someone noticed that her heart started beating again.  She was put in intensive care, where she was for a few days, before being returned to her care home, where she still is now.  She is fine, now.  That was like a month or two ago.  My daughter, when she told me about this, she said, &quot;That lady must have had some issues with God or something.&quot;  That was cute.  Yes, we are not in control.  He has the final say, doesn&#39;t He?
You know, when my daughter told me about this, I wondered, is that really possible?  Did guy make this up?  I still am not sure.  But, probably it really happened that way.
My mother was an RN, and I remember a story she told, of something similar to this, with a man having been pronounced dead, from a heart attack, and then in the ambulance he started breathing again.
It&#39;s weird.  I, personally, think God heard and answered your little prayer.  He does, you know, hear and answer.

		<Content>Hi!
I am very thankful to find this thread.  I have found that breast cancer is not just a physical battle but a spiritual one too.  I don&#39;t know what the controversy was about in this thread, since it was deleted but I hope that it continues to provide the kind of support I have been looking for.  We all have different needs and I need not only emotional and physical support but also spiritual support. To those who are offended by anything I say please forgive me.  I hope that you find what you need and can connect with others who are of like minds.  We are all in this together and hopefully can respect our diverse needs.  We get enough thoughtlessness from those who don&#39;t understand what we are going through.  Maybe we can just respect each other&#39;s need to connect with those of like minds and agree to disagree. Blessings on you all.

It depends on when you were originally reading this thead, it was up under Moving Beyond Cancer, but was changed to this area, by the moderator, Melissa, due to contraversy. It was a long story, and  I almost gave up on coming to this discussion site, but in the end, I realized I was taking it personal, and that I needed to let that go. I am just glad there are other women who enjoy and find comfort with a Christian/Spiritual thread. Life is too short to live in animosity, maybe that was my lesson to learn. I would like to say that God continues to give me patients who I learn from, who give me hope, and faith every night I work. Sometimes, I am the one giving back, and that&#39;s even sweeter. It&#39;s so blessed  to know we are giving back, that this experience is not in vain after all. God bless.</Content>

		<Content>Hi, Kathy.
I agree, &quot;God is the God of all comfort and we can comfort others with the comfort we have received from Him.&quot;  When I first found out that I had cancer, this was the verse that came to me, and still comes to me.  I love that there is a reason for this.
Anyway, I see that you have responded to my message about staging.  I&#39;m curious about you.  Um, like, when were you diagnosed, and have you finished treatment, and what surgery, etc., etc.?  Then, you are stage III?  III what?
It&#39;s good to know you.  My sister, not because of cancer, but because of Jesus.  My sister, for all eternity.  Oh, what joys we have ahead of us, not only in this life, but in the life to come.

		<Content>Heidi,
I don&#39;t understand.  I&#39;ve not been on this board for long, and I&#39;m reading about the posts that Rachel has made, but can&#39;t find any.  I&#39;d like to thank her, too, for starting this thread.
I need encouragement, from other Christians.  I love references to scriptures.
Like you, when I was first diagnosed, I turned everything over to God.  But, unlike you, I did not keep it there.  After surgery, when I found out the severity of my cancer, that it was in all 14 lymph nodes, my perspective changed.  I knew I was going to die, soon.  And, I felt that everything I had believed since childhood was an illusion, not a reality.  That when I died, it would just be black, nothing, no heaven, no nothing.  I can not tell you how dark I felt.
So, I began to look to God&#39;s word.  I went to the Psalms, and read that, hmm, David had felt the same way as I did.  I chose to go past my feelings, and consider them unreliable, and instead made the decision, without feelings to follow, to by faith trust God&#39;s word as true.  I would wake up, fearful, full of panic, horrible panic, and just cry out to God, outloud, and then open my Bible and find comfort there.  Nothing, no human being, could ever have brought me the comfort that His word did.
Now, I read on this thread that some don&#39;t like references to bible verses, or quotes.  But, I would love to see more of them, and would like to see talk of how those verses have brought encouragement.  I&#39;d love to share some, but am actually almost afraid of the rejection I might get.  That makes me sad.
Anyway, having finished treatment, my feelings are back in align with my faith.  I have hope again that God is indeed in control, and that He is sovereign and will work this all out for His glory.
So, anyway, where are Rachel&#39;s posts?

		<Content>Caroltina,
I do not know what stage I was except T-3, N-3, M-0.  That means that my tumor was stage three, measured 11 cm., I had no distant mets, 11 of 13 nodes were +.  My onc. said that more nodes than 10 made it a stage III.  My understanding is that the stage is more for treatment determination, although it is used statistically for prognosis.  However, prognosis is in God&#39;s hands.  I was diagnosed with ILC 12/03, started A/C in January 04 for 4 cycles.  I had a MRM in April 04, and started Taxotere three weeks later.  That bottomed out my ANC and I spent a couple of days in the hospital.  I got out the Saturday before Mother&#39;s Day last year.  I had 33 rads that ended September 04.  I figure if I have a 50-50 chance, then I&#39;ll take the 50% that says I&#39;ll be here a while.
I go for my check-up tomorrow.  I know that I had an estrogen level drawn to see if I&#39;m truly in menopause; I am assuming a CBC and chemistry profile was done, too.
I was thinking about the book of Job these last few days.  I do not think I suffered to the extent that he did, but I did think I would die from this disease.  At the end of the book, Job has a closer relationship with God than he did before; I can relate to that.  Sometimes we have friends that offer the same type of advice that Job&#39;s friends did.  Then we come around to thinking that we are unworthy to question God, but just to respond to His great love for us.  Our whole purpose in life is to bring glory to God!  I want to have the joy of the Lord even in the midst of trouble.
I am so glad to see this thread active again!  I cannot separate my life from my relationship with God the father, Jesus Christ His son, and the Holy Spirit.  This is who I am; body, soul, and spirit.  Our battle against any disease is physical, spiritual, and emotional/intellectual.  God has brought me through so much; I do not want to deny His power in my life.  Thank you for being like-minded and walking this walk with me.
My son was home from college this weekend and my daughter is about to leave home and move 350 miles away.  We had a family picture made while we could be together.  It was such a victory for me because we had a family picture made when I was first diagnosed.  At that time I thought I would die soon and this would be my last &quot;healthy-looking&quot; picture.  This time was a joy because I am here and victorious over this disease.  I really enjoyed my kids clowning around and having them all together for a few hours.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Kathy,
I&#39;m glad you responded to me.  I said &quot;Heidi&quot;, in the above message, but I meant Kathy. Yes, we are like minded.  I see that.  You are such a blessing to me.  Amazing, isn&#39;t it?!  My heart also is set on wanting my life to bring glory to God.  I&#39;ll talk more later.  Now I need to go to bed, though.  Thanks for posting a response to me.  I have much to share with you.
All for now.

		<Content>Our battle against any disease is physical, spiritual, and emotional/intellectual. God has brought me through so much; I do not want to deny His power in my life.

Kathy, I know what you mean. Sometimes I&#39;ll be answering a post to someone I don&#39;t know, and I find myself monitoring what I&#39;m saying, trying to leave out the spiritual part of this is tough, it&#39;s who we are. I&#39;m glad you are here, you bless us each time you post.

Our whole purpose in life is to bring glory to God! I want to have the joy of the Lord even in the midst of trouble.
Me too, but sometimes I am a pitiful witness, that&#39;s for sure. Lately, I have felt more disconnected from God, it&#39;s like I feel apathetic sometimes, just a vague feeling of emptiness. Hard to explain, but it feels like a part of me is deliberately pulling away, and I don&#39;t know why. What makes it so bad is I have just finished treatment, back to work, feeling better etc. and I should be even more joyous than I was during chemo etc.  For me, it&#39;s like the worse my circumstances, the closer I bring myself to God. That&#39;s a shame, it takes traumatic events for me to truly appreciate who He is in my life. I hate that. I think the Bible talks about this, doesn&#39;t it? If anyone knows the passages, let me know. I need to read it again. Guess it&#39;s a common fault we have, but it makes me feel like a hypocrite, unintentionally, but there it is. Thanks for listening.</Content>

		<Content>Thanks for your posts about the Lord.
I have found out so much more about Him since going through cancer. Whats important in this life and whats not.
Trusting in Him to show my doctors  what to do with me.
Knowing I can not add a extra day to my life, He has them all written down. It has brought my husband and children closer also.
I don&#39;t get to church like I used to because of my health, but I sure have had great times in worship at home. I put worship music on and my soul rests.
Bless all of my sisters out there.
We are being refined through the fire.

		<Content>Hi there, Rachel &amp;amp; Kathy.

I&#39;m frustrated.  I just typed a whole bunch in here, and then went back to find that II Corinthians bible verse reference, and lost everything I&#39;d written.  I could be discouraged about that, and not try to write it again.  Hm. Who would benefit from that?  The enemy of our souls. I&#39;m not going to give him that pleasure!
So, let me gather my thoughts.
I know how I started out.  Yes, I confessed:
I have a confessin to make.  I&#39;ve been hiding.  Besides being a Christian, my husband and I have been missionaries to Mexico for the past 8 years, before this last year.  You can see us at
if you are interested, and see me when I had breasts of my own.  The loss of my breasts is one kind of loss.  The loss of our home in Mexico, and our friends and ministry there, is another.  We are planning a trip next month, for a month, maybe, but quite likely will not return there, full-time, ever.
We had been coming home for visits a couple of times a year.  Last year, this month, we came home for more than a visit.  We came to help our youngest daughter, Andrea, with the crisis in her life.  She had two little boys under 3, and was pregnant.  Her husband had left her, for her best friend.  She needed us.  We thought he&#39;d be back.  We thought we&#39;d go back, once they reconciled.
We got on State medical insurance, just &#39;cuz, and had medical checkups, as it had been a while since we had done that.  Well, I had a checkup a year before, but no mammogram, for like 7 years.  And my hubby had his checkup, and test for prostate cancer.
Lo and behold, we both had cancer.  He ended up having his prostate removed in November, caught it early, so no problem there.  He was in surgery when I was getting chemo.

I&#39;m having trouble focusing to get this written, but want to do it.  The first time writing wasn&#39;t so difficult.
Another factor in this picture is that we have a special needs son, who we found in Mexico.  When we first got him, 6 years ago, at almost 10 years of age, he weighed only 212 pounds.  You can see him on that photo link I gave you.  That&#39;s Marcos.
Marcos has grown, almost to 5 feet, and weighs a little over 70 pounds now.  He has gotten better, developmentally, and physically, and then gotten worse, better and worse, better, and worse, all through these years.  Now he is having to eat via a GI tube.  That has actually helped him, though.
A plus is that we have Marcos in school for the first time in his life.  It&#39;s a special ed class, and he loves it.  They&#39;re working on getting a computer system set up, for communication.  He&#39;s real spastic, though, but when he wants, motivated.  He&#39;s not having as many seizures, and sort of has a little bit of a life now.
Marcos has been a real big issue for me, since my husband and I got cancer.  I felt that we could not care for him.  I felt, a lack of compassion, a pulling away from caring for him.  I felt he was cheating me of my last year with my husband.  (Yes, I thought I was going to die right away.)  I felt that we should have just let him die.  I felt all alone in our responsibility in caring for him.  Also, I felt that we weren&#39;t doing good enough of a job caring for him.  I felt sorry for him.  I felt like he needed to be in a care facility, or foster home.  And worried that, if I die, that it will put too big of a burden on my hubby, all alone.  Or on me, all alone, if he dies.
Well, I don&#39;t know what will come of our boy.  But, I am, praise God, finally starting to be able to feel love toward him again.  Not that I didn&#39;t feel it.  It was there.  I just refused to let it out.  I guess I was afraid to.  I don&#39;t know.  Plus, caring for him, changing his poopy diapers, just repulsed me, when on treatment.  And the smell of urine and stuff.
No one can relate to this!  No one.  Can you?  I don&#39;t think so.  It&#39;s still hard.
We had a beautiful house.  We sold it, paid off all our debts, before we went to Mexico.  That was fine, while we were in Mexico. We built a house there in Mexico, and though humble, it was so nice.  It&#39;s beautiful there!  I miss it there.  I miss the morning doves, and the sounds of life, children, roosters, woodpeckers.  I miss my dog!
Anyway, now that we are here, I miss my home, the one we sold.  I think sometimes that we goofed by doing that.  That if we had not done that, I would have had my mamograms every year, and caught this.  I know that isn&#39;t true.  I think I know that.  I think this was a quick grower, little, but quick.
I want to be able to just go someplace and go home, to my home, 5 bedrooms it had, room enough for our daughter and grandkids, and our son.
Then, I think about the people in Mexico.  There is one man who I know most likely would have never come to know the Lord, if we had not been there.  Jeff.  We used his internet system there.  He was a bitter grump, and then we started coming to use his system, in trade for my husband&#39;s help in keeping it working.  Long story short, we led him to the Lord.  His life was transformed.  He came back to the States a year ago, also, and since then has left this earthly home, gone to wait for us, died of cancer, which he had battled a very long time.
Well, we don&#39;t have our home to come home to.  We have an apartment, right next to our daughter and our three grandchildren. We are for the first time getting to really know our grandchildren.  We&#39;ve been able to watch our youngest, a little girl, from birth to almost a year old now, and help out, every day, with their care.  Our daughter is now studying to be an RN.  Able to do that because we are here.  She helps us with Marcos, too.  Her husband has divorced her, and she is getting on with life.  Made much easier because we are here for her.
It is true, Kathy, that God does not allow things in our lives to hurt us.  He is sovereign.  He knows, every detail.  Your words about Job, how that what he went through, after he went through it, he was closer to God, that&#39;s really a comfort to me.  That&#39;s what I want.  That&#39;s what I want more than anything!  I just prayed that, actually, to God yesterday. Like you, Rachel, I find myself, now that I am done with treatment, and those huge emotions are kind of died down, I find myself pulling away from God.  Feeling like a hypocrite.  Yesterday I just decided to talk to Him, no matter what I felt.  Coming from inside, deep inside, I heard myself pray, &quot;God, I just want to know You, more than anything else in this life, that&#39;s what I want.  I want to live for You, to please You, to be like You, to bring You glory.  Help me!  I can&#39;t do it, or want it, or know how, without Your help.&quot;  Then I got on this web, and saw that Kathy had posted.  It really helps.  It does.
I have Christian friends here and stuff.  But, it just doesn&#39;t feel right to burden them with this cancer stuff, and these feelings related to that, again and again and again.  We need each other.
Please, let&#39;s be here for each other.  Let&#39;s not hide.  I mean, garsh, I&#39;m chancing a lot here.  Sharing that I&#39;m a missionary.  I feel like I am, anyway.
Did I say that, &quot;I&#39;m a missionary.&quot; ??  Well, I am.  I still am.  We are trying to get involved in ministry here. (Beyond church.) We&#39;re looking into it.  My hubby and I went to the mission here, where homeless and needy people go, and inquired what we can do.  Found some good possibilities there for us, with the hispanic people.
Anyway, I&#39;ve babbled, and babbled, and babbled.  At least I got it out.  I can quit hiding.
The Lord bless you, and keep you, and make His face to shine upon you - - in the midst of all you are going through.

		<Content>Oh, Carol,
How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!  I am so glad you shared.  I feel like I really know you, now.  You certainly don&#39;t need to hide from anyone.  You are the brave one; selling what you own to go and minister to others.  My husband and I minister to needy people that God puts in our path.  We are counseling a couple who will be married in a couple of weeks tonight.  They had originally asked my husband to marry them.  He did not feel that he could do that, and he is not ordained.  Since we are involved in a Baptist church right now, we want to be submissive to the leadership, but we are continuing to counsel them.  It amazes me how many people are saved, but do not know how to live life to the fullest.  THey know enough to be saved, but do not continue to grow.  It seems that we have encountered many people like this.  We have a life group that meets at our house on Sunday nights and my husband leads the discussion.  It is a time of sharing and prayer that is very meaningful in our lives.
I had my three-month check-up today and I am doing the happy dance.  The hormone levels indicated that I am indeed in menopause so very low estrogen production - good thing.  My other lab work was good.  I&#39;m good to go for another three months!
God bless your day!

		<Content>Congratulations on your three month check-up.  I have an appointment for a check-up on the 17th.  We can cheer each other on.  OK?
That&#39;s funny.  I just read over my entry, and realized that I had said that my son had only weighed 212 pounds.  Well, no, that is not correct.  He weighed 21 pounds, and was 1 meter long, or tall, at almost 10 years of age.  How silly.
Although I guess it is almost more believable that he weighed 212 pounds at 10 years, than 21 pounds at 10 years.
That was such a long time ago.  So many changes since then.

Anyway, I think that is good that you and your husband are counseling your friends, but are not going to marry them, and that you see the wisdom in listening to the advice of the leadership in your church.  You are right about people not going on, moving forward, growing, after they come to the Lord.  That&#39;s a dangerous place to be, because it is so easy for them to fall, then, into any temptation that comes along, like my son-in-law did.  It is a dangerous place for any of us to be.  We need to draw close, every day, take time to listen to Him, through His word, every day.  I don&#39;t.  I fall away, emotionally, at times.  I don&#39;t get enough connectedness with other Christians, and people in general.  The culture here is so busy.  People don&#39;t have time for each other.  They work, go to church once a week, maybe, and then go back to work on Monday.  In Mexico there were always people to talk to.  I think I will feel more connected once I started getting involved with the Mission downtown.
Anyway, I started a bible study online today, through a Baptist Church.  A friend of mine gave me the link.  It looks like it will be very basic and fundamental, good stuff.  The link for that, in case you or someone else is interested, is:
I have a cold today.  Rrrr.  I thought I was just sneezing over some hair gel that someone gave me, as I am quite sensitive to perfumes, and it is perfumed quite a bit.  Well, now my nose is all stuffed up.  It&#39;s a cold.
My poor boy, Marcos, had a bad day at school today.  He had two seizures.  He&#39;s started something new, which we thought he only did here.  He cries.  Never did that before.  He starts out kind of like he is laughing, and then we realize he&#39;s crying.  The teacher called us today and asked if he&#39;d done that before.  It is frustrating, not knowing what is wrong.  He can be crying like that, and then 15 minutes later bouncing away on the bed, happy as can be, which, btw (by the way) he is doing right now.  Maybe he just wanted to be home today.  His assistant teacher, that is assigned to him, wasn&#39;t there today, and won&#39;t be for two weeks.  His wife just gave birth to their first baby, a boy.
Well, I will -
TTYL (talk to you later)
Again, congrats on your 3 month good report!

		<Content>The other night at work  either 3 or 4 of my patients were females with breast cancer/mets or ovarian cancer. That was 50% of my patients that night. I don&#39;t think that was a fluke, since none of the other nurses had patients with bc. To me, I was given everyone of these patients for a reason, once again. It was amazing, they were all in different stages of their life/recovery/diagnosis. There is such a bond, at least from point of view, with these women. One of them told was 63, had bilat mast. in 98 with immediate reconstruction, trap flap. She acted like she was 43, maybe even 33! She was a hoot to be sure! The one thing she said that was discouraging to me was that she hadn&#39;t had it in her lymph nodes when diagnosed. She then went on to say &quot;cause once it gets in your lymph nodes you&#39;re gone&quot;. ROFLOL I had to laugh silently inside, what else could my node positive butt do???? Also, the fact that she had cirrohsis from alcoholism didn&#39;t give her much credibility.

Remember the first patient I had when I returned to work? the one who was newly diagnosed with liver cancer and needed a port placed, but was afraid? I still had my suture in my chest from having my port out the day prior, so I showed her mine??? Well, she was my patient again Tuesday night. She looks real sick, not doing well at all. She remembered me, and I thought it a priviledge to have her as a patient again. I know it may not look good for her, but I still needed to see her again. If nothing else, to appreciate how blessed I am.
Also, remember the lady from the 2nd day of work who had bc mets for years, had lost her DH to cancer in December and her daughter to bc too? She died a couple weeks ago, after all that struggling to survive for so long. She just got so tired of fighting, and I guess she wanted/needed to rest, and be with her loved ones. It was sad, but again, I see how blessed I was to have met her before her death, what an impact she made on everyone who met her. An awesome lady! Anyways, going back to bed. Gonna get a few zzzz&#39;s, have to work 3pm til 3:30am tonight.</Content>

		<Content>I have read all of your posts today and I am so warmed by them. I am going back to have a recheck on calcifications and do not know what the results will be. I have so enjoyed the chatrooms and the discussion boards and this one has been such an inspiration to me. I am a Christian and I am so thankful for my faith....and all of yours too. We all need to pray for each other daily. And I hope anyone that wants to post bible verses will feel free to do so. That is HIS word.</Content>

		<Content>KJA,
Thanks for the encouragement to post Bible verses, and to pray for one another. I will be praying for you regarding the tests you are having.
RACHEL,
I enjoyed your update about your patients.  I will pray that you have many more opportunities to share God&#39;s love, and that He gives you tenderness and courage to do so.
I&#39;ll be watching for some Bible verses.
And here&#39;s one from me to you:

&quot;Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.&quot; I Thess.5:11

		<Content>KATHY,
How are you doing?  You are in my prayers.  Do you homeschool?
FOR ALL OF YOU -
This poem was sent to me by a friend:
GOD SPEAKING
The man whispered, &quot;God speak to me&quot;
And a meadowlark sang
But the man did not hear.
So the man yelled, &quot;God, speak to me&quot;
And the thunder and lightning rolled across the sky
But the man did not listen.
The man looked around and said, &quot;God let me see you.&quot;
And a star shined brightly.
But the man did not see.
And the man shouted, &quot;God show me a miracle.&quot;
And a life was born.
But the man did not notice.
So the man cried out in despair, &quot;Touch me, God and let
me know you are here!&quot;
Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man.
But the man brushed the butterfly away and walked on.
(I found this to be a great reminder that God is always
around us in the little simple things that we take for granted.
The good new is that you are loved.
Don&#39;t miss out on a blessing because it isn&#39;t packaged the way that you expect.
&quot;Expect the Unexpected!&quot;
&quot;Have a Happy Day!&quot;)
AUTHOR UNKNOWN
I thought that was sweet.  May God touch your life in a special way, today!

		<Content>Thanks for the encouragement KJfromVA. You are from my neck of the woods, well at least the first 35 years of my life. Ashamed to say I am also the one who posts the crazy redneck jokes...hope you don&#39;t mind.
I love being a redneck, just eventually learned to CELEBRATE who I am, even down here in Florida. They pretty much have gotten used to me, and my redneck ways. LOL
Having a hard time keeping a promise to myself and others, that I would accept God&#39;s decision (with graciousness) on my potential promotion. I knew it&#39;d be hard if I didn&#39;t get it,  but tonight I feel like an angry bitter woman. I hate that. I know perfectly well that God has another plan for me, but I am at odds as to what to do with what I&#39;ve been offered. It&#39;s so much easier to talk the talk than it is to walk the walk. Maybe I need to just be more careful of what I say in the first place.
&#39;
I had a patients church friend pray an IV in for me tonight. Sounds like a joke, but it was actually true. This lady had a horrible car accident, face really messed up etc. but came out very very lucky, considering she hadn&#39;t worn a seat belt. She is from the Brownsville Assembly of God (a well known church in this area, I think). She has horrible veins, the first one blew after I got the IV in place. Her church sister came to visit, and I asked her to pray for my success, and of course she did, and the IV went in a much smaller vein than the first one, and was just fine the rest of the shift, comfortable to the patient as well. God puts those kind of IV&#39;s in the patients, my hands are just the vessel He uses, cuz I sure don&#39;t have the same success when I try doing it &#39;alone&#39;. LOL The visitor told the patient &quot;God sent her to you&quot; and that&#39;s all it took!  I told the visitor how much I believed in prayer, and then why I believed it so much (my bc experience and God&#39;s grace in it all). I told her of how specific God has been, in the patients I get,their diagnosis etc. It was a wonderful experience, being able to discuss it openly like that, witho someone who believes too. I am thankful that I can do this at my job, without fear of reprimand, it&#39;s a Catholic hospital. We have evening prayers every night over head on the intercom, as well as verses etc. It&#39;s the biggest hospital in this area, but it feels small and personal when you hear the daily prayers in the morning and evening. Sometimes God really amazes me, He really does. And now I just need to give Him credit for what He has already done, that promotion was not meant for me, and I need to remember that, and put my foolish pride out of the way. He has something else in mind for me, and I&#39;ll recognize it when the time comes. Besides, I would have very little interaction with patients in that other position, and right now, that just don&#39;t seem like the right thing for me to do. Thank you all for reading and listening, and your prayers are very much appreciated too. Good night moon.</Content>

		<Content>Welcome KJ from VA!  It is great to have the encouragement of the &quot;sistas&quot;.
Carol, yes I do homeschool and have been for the past 12 years.  I have two that are out of high school and on to college and two that are at home.  It is more parent directed education at this point.  They are 16 and 14.  The older one has a math tutor as he has passed my ability, and we participate in a home school co-op that has classes one day a week during the traditional school year.  I am on the founding committee and we offer Spanish, art, drafting, writing, apologetics, literature, science, and sometimes aerodynamics and electronics.  I will be doing a Shakespeare class for high school in the fall.  I have done this before and it is a lot of fun.  I like to get the kids whose parents make them take the class.  They think that Shakespeare is so old and out of date.  I like to get their reactions when they realize that he was very funny and knew a lot about people.
Rachel,  I am glad you did not get the promotion.  You would give up the personal work God has you doing.  You are touching lives in a way that you have never before been able to do.  Your care and comfort to those patients you&#39;ve shared with us is very real and eternally valuable.  In fifty years will it matter that you got the promotion?  In fifty years it will matter who you encouraged and pointed to Jesus.  That is an eternal difference.  One may be more glamourous, but that tempts our pride and God opposes the proud.  I know you know this, and I&#39;m not meaning to be preachy.  I love your stories!
I went for a three month check-up this week and I am officially in menopause.  I was complaining about the muscle cramps and the &quot;old lady&quot; feeling.  It is getting better, but I still have days of it.  My onc. said that chemo deconditions our bodies and that it takes six months to a year to get reconditioned again.  It affects every muscle of our bodies.  I could yawn and my chin/neck would cramp.  I also saw the doctor for the LE and my arm is slightly smaller.  I am determined to drop thirty pounds before I go back.  Please help me be accountable for this.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Susan, sorry to hear about Buster.  I, too, will pray for comfort for Mike and Cherie.  We have a rather old, ailing dog.  And even though I know her time is coming soon, it will be hard.  She&#39;s a 15 yr old lab (I thought they usually only lived to be around 12).
Kathy, welcome!!  I&#39;m in Texas, too!!  I saw in another thread where you said you lived in the Dallas area.  Yep, that&#39;s me, too.  PM (private message)me if you want to compare doctors, etc.  I did not do radiation, but I know plenty of people around here who did.
Nicole, welcome, also!!  I love your screen name.  We are victorious, aren&#39;t we!  Praise be to God!!
Debby, Thank you for your faithfulness to pray for us! I appreciate you and pray for you, as well.
Patti, good to see you here, too.
hugs,
Wendy</Content>

		<Content>If your feelings get hurt because someone looks at you crossways or because friends or family forget your birthday, you need to spend more time with God.  He will fill you with so much love and such a sense of self-worth that you won&#39;t feel ill-tempered or touchy toward anyone. Seek god with your whole heart today.  Talk to Him about your problems and then enjoy yourself, knowing that He cares for you.

		<Content>I was dx on Sept 12, and I can truly feel God working in my life.  My husband and I teach a SS class of 5th and 6th graders.  We have, what I feel, is the best most awesome church family anywhere.  They have crowded around me and lifted me and my family up in prayers and I can feel them working.  I go to the dr tomorrow for my 1 week post op for my left mast.  I know God is listening and responding to all of our prayers.
I have two teenage sons, one is 18 and the other almost 16.  they both work at Chick-fil-A, which is a very Christian organization.  I came home after my surgery and the younger one wanted to goeat at Chick-fil-A.  The older one said he would take him, but they would go through the drive through.  The younger one wanted to go in and socialize.  They were going back and forth, not arguing just yes no type of thing.  I closed my eyes and said a silent prayer, thanking God for getting me through the surgery but could He possibly deal with the boys because I couldn&#39;t.  I opened my eyes and told my youngest that I would go see if his dad would take him.  By the time I got outside, my oldest son came out and said that it was their manager from work on the phone asking what he could bring us to eat.  Talk about God answering a prayer quickly.  It was only a matter of about two minutes at the most.  So, I know that if God can answer a prayer that is that tiny (in my eyes) then I know that He is going to get me through this ordeal with bc.  Just wanted to share that with you all.  Love, Bonny</Content>

		<Content>The Bible teaches that Satan tries to build strongholds in our lives.  One way to identify the strongholds in your life is to watch for repetitive situations that pull you down in spirit.  We all know inside when something is not right in our life or is getting out of control.  If that happens to you, seek God early to find out what is going on.

		<Content>Thanks, I received good news.  My dr said there were clear margins.   It was stage 2.  I am not sure what kind I have or had since she got it all.  Do I still say I have BC even though I don&#39;t have the breast it was in?  I don&#39;t know.  Alcoa is about 15 minutes south of Knoxville.     It is the home of ALCOA Aluminum company.  Gid was with me today and he is still with me and will be with me through my chemo and radiation.  Hugs, Bonny</Content>

		<Content>Why God Made Friends

God made the world with a heart full of love,
Then He looked down from Heaven above,
And saw that we all need a helping hand,
Someone to share with, who&#39;ll understand.
He made special people to see us through
The glad times and the sad times, too;
A person on whom we can always depend,
Someone we can call a friend.
God made friends so we&#39;ll carry a part
Of His perfect love in all our hearts.</Content>

		<Content>This is such a wonderful site.  I have only been on here for a few weeks but I already feel  like I am among friends and family.  I pray that God will take this awful disease away from each and every one of us that has it.  I KNow God is with me every step of the way and I thank Him daily for all the wonderful things in my life.  My boys (age 18 and almost 16) were in a car accident on Friday morning and the car was totaled.  My oldest rear-ended another car.  I wasn&#39;t upset about the car.  I thanked God that they weren&#39;t hurt.  Just shook up.  I am trying to find the good in everything that God has sent my way and I have to admit  it is hard.  But several people have told me that they have had their mammos and one friend is getting a lump checked.  She said she probably wouldn&#39;t have had it not been for my bc.  So I am thanking God for everything.  He will get us through it.  Thank you God for my salvation and my family and my friends.  I owe it all to YOU!   Bonny</Content>

		<Content>Love is patient,love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.

		<Content>Susan, thank you for posting those lovely thoughts from Corinthians.  I needed to read this today ~ I find that whenever I am struggling with something or I am challenged by something, when I ask for direction or signs to point me the right way, I do receive them.  Thank you for being a blessing today.</Content>

		<Content>Tomorrow I&#39;m having my first muga scan (to check the blood flow through my heart) since starting herceptin in April.  The ejection fractions need to be high enough for me to continue and I very much want to continue with this drug.
Please say a prayer for me tonight that the herceptin is doing it&#39;s job, has not affected my heart in any way and that this test will go well.
As always I am blessed and grateful for the love and support that you give every day.</Content>

I&#39;m praying for you today!!
I haven&#39;t been on in awhile and don&#39;t currently have time to read all of the posts (kids went back to school this week &amp;amp; I&#39;ve been working up at the school), but I did read yours.   Please let us know how it all went.
Btw, I love your avatar.  It&#39;s precious!

		<Content>Thank you so much to all of you for your kind thoughts and your prayers.  The muga scan was fine...poor technician had to use my hand to find a vein for the dye &amp;amp; then the tracer but she did a great job and the bruises aren&#39;t too bad (call me tomorrow!
).  Now it&#39;s just waiting until  Wednesday (23rd) when I go for my next herceptin to see if the fractions are where they should be.
I truly value and appreciate your concern and your prayers.  The support we show for one another makes such a difference.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you Susan.  I&#39;m having such a tough day.  I think a lot of people here are having a tough day.  Right now the muga scan (I think!) is the least of my worries...right now it&#39;s that phone call from my family doctor&#39;s office, just before they closed for the weekend to tell me to call them back.  Great!!  Thank you for allowing me to worry myself sick for a couple of days...and I know (and so many wonderful women have reminded me of this!) if it&#39;s seriously urgent, my doctor will call again.
I&#39;m putting this down to the guy on the phone, who is &quot;just doing his job&quot; and not even thinking about what impact his words or actions have had.  Last year he called me about some blood work my son had done and said it in such a way as to make me understand there was a problem with his blood, when in fact there was not.
I still have no idea what this could be and I am working on the theory that my doctor is being the thorough woman she is and letting me know the results of the thyroid test.  I may well need to go back to for meds.  But when we do speak and I have the opportunity, I will quite probably write a letter to show how things like this can be avoided in future..for others.  Perhaps there is a good lesson to come from this experience and I am all for offering suggestions rather than just &quot;complaining&quot;.
Thank you all for being the wonderfully caring, spiritual invividuals that you are.
I am so blessed to have met you all.</Content>

Sherry I can&#39;t count how many times I have read this happening to others here and in my own experience or
for a tech asking a question or a statement that makes all your flags go up ! There need to be policy put in place in some offices to help avoid this heart pumping event.
I have had this kind of phone call over questions about insurance too this was abnormal we need too... geez!
I agree Sherry with everyone else Your Doctor would call
back!

		<Content>Hi Sherry,
Remember the person who called probably does not have breast cancer and has no idea of the reaction you are having.  He/she lives in another world.  To them this is a ROUTINE call.  Nothing to worry about.  (I hope one day we get to make them pay!!!)  LOL

Again I tell you, if two of you on earth agree (harmonize together, make a symphony together) about whatever (anything and everything) they may ask, it will come to pass and be done for them by My Father in heaven.
----Mathew 18:19
Shery we are all praying for your peace and good health.
God Bless,
Susan</Content>

		<Content>Hello to all:   i&#39;m a newcomer to this thread and to this cancer world in general.  just diagnosed late april and had 3 surgeries since then w/treatments to begin next month (june).   dx w/metaplastic carcinoma, triple negative....a rare and rather daunting type and future outlook.
 looks like no activity on this thread for awhile.  this one seems too good to let it die out.  I&#39;m a Christian and have been for many years.  am 58 years old w/ 2 grown daughters and 3 grandsons.
 I&#39;m interested in keeping this board alive and kicking if anyone else is......hope to hear from someone who feels the same.

		<Content>Hi dsa--outtahere, yes I&#39;ll chime in. Some good stuff on this thread and some time Id like to go through the whole thing when I get the time and inclination. Just reading your prognosis...I pray that God will be with you no matter what! For sure cancer is a rotten thing and I dont profess to know all the whys and wherefores, but thankfully God DOES!!! Im middish 50s and have been a Christian for years too.
 Indeed Jesus is Lord.</Content>

		<Content>hello musical!  had bout decided this thread was on the &#39;other side&#39; &amp;amp; perhaps it should be???  i&#39;ve been posting on another fantastic thread for middle age to older Christian women.  take a look &amp;amp; see what u think---i&#39;ve been so blessed by those ladies and we&#39;ve developed a bond that is special....how could it not be when the BC sisters are also sisters in Christ!!
 i&#39;ll probably stay with that thread because there is never a day that we let go without someone touching base.  there are a couple of other threads as well that are more &#39;prayer for one another&#39; related that i&#39;ve become active on, too.
 i actually start chemo this friday and continue to be strengthened.encouraged &amp;amp; taught by the ladies on these other threads.  Had melanoma many years ago when i was &#39;a baby&#39; at 22 and never gave cancer another thought until 2 years ago when my mom caught the sign of a small lump in her breast and a lumpectomy was immediately performed---she was 84 at the time!!  i think i got over that fairly easily since all she had was radiation.  again, i dismissed the signifance of the same thing occurring to me!   i should have expected it because, my mom, her sister, and their aunt (on the maternal side) all experienced BC----so, why was I so blinded to the STRONG likelihood that I would also be a victim?!?!
 putting the 20/20 hindsight behind me, i am where i am &amp;amp; it is of no news to God!  lessons to be learned from this trip can only become as helpful &amp;amp; useful as I ask of the Lord.  otherwise, my flesh will thrash around and i will possibly become distraught, depressed &amp;amp; overcome by the sheer force of this beast.  
 not that you wanted to hear about the above, i share it because these other threads have kept me mindful that God&#39;s ways are not mine nor must I understand the &#39;why&#39; of things---His plans are perfect for me, with no intent to harm me..... even though i won&#39;t know the full story until i join Him in glory!!!!!

		<Content>Hi again! Yes sometimes I think  some threads could actually be better off winding up and starting off fresh, if you know what I mean. Thanks for sharing some of your story and its always good to be a good listener to others probs and not just concentrate on our own : ), and thanks for the heads up about the other threads. I&#39;ll go check em out soon.  
 Cheers

		<Content>Carrie,
Thank you!  I look forward to getting to know you better as well.
I feel such peace knowing that I have given and turned over all my worries and fears about bc to Jesus.  He sustains me and gives strenght to my vast support system-especially my husband.
Hugs &amp;amp; blessings to you and to all our bc sisters!

I&#39;m glad you found this thread, too!  These women are so special.  It&#39;s comforting to know that if I don&#39;t get to meet them here on Earth, I&#39;ll see them in Heaven!!  (but I do think it would be fun to have a rendezvous here, too)
To Kim &amp;amp; everyone else, have a great day!!

		<Content>I receive a message in my email every day from the Joel Osteen Ministry.  I very much liked today&#39;s talking about Random Acts of Kindness. I believe this is something that we do each and every day on this board and I would say that most of us do this in our day to day lives.  But it&#39;s always a message worth repeating.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A reporter was interviewing people whose homes had been destroyed by Hurricane Ivan.  An interesting theme emerged.  Each person said that although they didn&#39;t know their neighbors before the storm hit, they had since become friends.  This all took place as they helped each other out whenever they could.  They gave each other water, helped clear debris, and watched each other&#39;s children.  One woman who never even took the time to cook her own meals before the storm now prepared dinner for 25 neighbors in her RV because she was the only one who had a working stove.
Sometimes tragedy brings out the best in us.  We can be very generous when the need is desperate and obvious.  But we need to remember that there are people all around us who are facing the desperate storms of life and their needs may not be so obvious.  We may have to look a little bit harder to see how they are hurting and determine how we can help.
We encourage you to keep your eyes and your heart open to those you meet each day.  Begin to focus on how you can be a blessing to others.  Maybe it is something as simple as speaking a kind word or taking someone groceries.  Look for opportunities to do random acts of kindness; these are expressions of God&#39;s love to the world.  One thing for certain, as we meet the needs of others God will meet all of your needs in ways you never imagined.
~ Joel Osteen ~
Bless your day.</Content>

		<Content>Okay, so inside this warrior there&#39;s a child...and sometimes people/family, friends forget that...in my attempt to be strong; to overcome; to comfort others...and I love all of that...
But sometimes...this child just climbs up on Dad&#39;s lap and it goes something like this: &quot;Daddy, can you have the angels sing me to sleep?&quot; or &quot;Hey, Dad, what&#39;s up with the world from your perspective, because from mine it stinks&quot;; or &quot;Abba, Father, I am soooooo scared; can I tuck my head under Your powerful arm and hide from reality for a little while?&quot; &quot;Father God, do ya think Jesus could explain it...or H.S. (Holy Spirit) could counsel me on this?&quot;
And then, after a time, I get down and come back...sometimes quietly, sometimes excitedly, sometimes with lots of trepidation...but I do get down and come back...and will continue to...until He brings me HOME...
Love and blessings to all of you from my heart.</Content>

		<Content>Jan, that is very nice.  Father, can you ask the angels to sing me to sleep.
One of the pastors from my former church called me while I was in chemo.  It was exactly the right day.  He knew what I needed to hear.  He reminded me that God was my father and he was going to take care of me.  I was so comforted.  Thanks for bringing up that memory.

		<Content>Hello again mrsjck,
I loved your message.  Just wanted to share a thought that I read the other day &quot;I am a survivor.  Being a survivor doesn&#39;t mean that you are made out of steel, but it means you are basically on your own side and you want to win&quot;.
This really hit home for me because I am a survivor, but I know that without God on my side I can&#39;t survive.
Love and Blessings on this lovely Sunday morning in Illinois.

		<Content>Hi girls!
I&#39;ve been out of town and away from the boards for a few.  Hope everyone is doing well!
Jan, I loved your post.  I do think of God that way - as my Abba - Father.  I lost my own real father 11 years ago, and my mom 27 years ago (wow, didn&#39;t realize it had been that long!!!)  I remember thinking (even tho&#39; I was a married adult with kids, etc) that I was an orphan!  I no longer had my daddy to call on Sunday mornings before the house was awake and share quiet moments together.
But the Lord quickly and lovingly swooped me up into His arms, so to speak, and reminded me that He was still there (and would always be there).  So, I do often think of God as &quot;my Daddy&quot;.  Thank you for reminding me of that once more.
Hugs,
Wendy
p.s.  I also like to think that since I&#39;m a child of the King, that makes me a princess!!</Content>

		<Content>Praise the Lord, Wendy, for saying what I have been feeling for a number of years...on the princess thing...in fact, I taught my children to behave well; speak softly and justly; act kindly and thnk of others because they were royalty...that my son was a prince and my daughter a princess because that&#39;s what I was...as a believer and child of the King...WOW...never heard anyone else say that...thanks for that...on my maternal family side we each have the second toe that is as tall or taller than the big toe...we always call that our &quot;royal toe&quot;...and when we are looking down...or feeling down...it&#39;s a reminder of who we are...or how about this one...when you are so down and dark, sitting with your hands on your head...just move those fingers and press lightly on the eyelids...and see your inner world...all twinkly lights...and the world will not be so dark...God bless all of you...from my heart.</Content>

		<Content>I guess I had not considered myself &amp;amp; family being royalty, but it makes so much sense.  Our King graciousness provides all of us with royalty status!  Let the humbleness and love of our Lord &amp;amp; King be with all of you!!
One favor- Could you fine ladies pray for me?  My platelets are low so I was not able to get treatment today &amp;amp; my CT scan showed one area (lymph node) that increased in size.
Blessings &amp;amp; peace &amp;amp; love to you all!

		<Content>Kim, I suffered with low platelets 14 years ago, long before bc and did manage to get that corrected (by having my spleen removed ultimately).  I know how serious an issue low platelets is.
Please know that you are in my thoughts &amp;amp; my prayers ~ for your platelets to multiply and &quot;stay&quot; up and because of the lymph node that has increased in size.</Content>

		<Content>Cowgirl, I am praying for you and your mom.  The way your mom is right now, you have lost the mom you knew.  It&#39;s like she&#39;s gone while she&#39;s still here.  And it&#39;s hard on you physically and emotionally.  Losing a mom, no matter how we lose her changes us in a way nothing else ever does.
Sending you gentle knowing ((((((((((((((((hugs)))))))))))))))) and praying for you both.
I saw that you mentioned in &quot;what the heck&quot; that you are thinking about counselling.  I&#39;ve been there, done that ~ one of the best things I ever did for myself.  It&#39;s cleansing, empowering and healing in a way that nothing can describe.  If you seek that route, I send you my blessings.</Content>

		<Content>I truly feel better sorta. I am trusting in God to be the Great Comforter right now. He knows my heart best. I love this thread where you can cry it all out and then praise God for all your blessings.
Counseling is something I have done in the past through a crisis, but I honestly try to avoid because it ain&#39;t cheap! Money is tight, and I feel a bit guilty needing counseling.
But I know I need a pro to let me get it all out and learn how to deal with all the stress of it all.</Content>

		<Content>I read these quotes last night and thought they were so appropriate and so fitting when we are struggling...
&quot;The spiritual journey is one of continually falling on your face, getting up, brushing yourself off, looking sheepishly at God, and taking another step.&quot;
~  Aurobindo ~
This also asks a question.  We pray and we ask for prayers from one another here when we are struggling, when the days are darkest.  What if we also asked to be prayed for when the sun is shining, when life is looking it&#39;s best and we have locked our fears back into the closet until they knock loudly to be released?  Would that mean we would need to pray over our fears less?  Musings with you ladies for a sunny, summer Sunday morning.
&quot;You pray in your distress and in your need,
would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.&quot;
~ Kahlil Gibran ~</Content>

		<Content>Psalm 6: 2,6- 9
 ..............Have mercy on me, O Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled........
 I am weary with my groaning; all night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears. ............. the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord has heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.
  Praise the Lord for so many praying / trusting/ and believing people on this board!
 Matthew Henry - &amp;quot;Prayer is the key of the morning and the bolt of the evening.&amp;quot;
 God help us all!

		<Content>It&#39;s wonderful how God redeems the horrible things in our life into something beautiful.
 It is a little hard for me to relate to many of you bc sisters in that many of you had more severe cancers. But, I&#39;m thrilled to see that you are trusting God thru it and your faith shines.
 Personally, I believe no cancer bullet will touch me without God&#39;s permission. When its my time to go, I&#39;ll step from earth to glory. We pass from life to life. Everything is meant for my good...of course in the moment surgery hurts, and the journey is rough...but God is Lord in it all.</Content>

		<Content>This spoke to me today - so I thought I should share it.
 The Lord told Paul in Acts 18:10, &amp;quot;I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&amp;quot;
 The word &amp;quot;always&amp;quot; here literally means &amp;quot;all the days.&amp;quot; That takes into account all our various activities, the good and bad circumstances, through storm clouds and sunshine. Our Lord is present no matter what a day brings - be it - joy or sadness, sickness or health, success or failure.
 No matter what happens to us today, our Lord is walking beside us, strengthening us, loving us, filling us with faith, hope, and love. We can make it through any thing because we know the Lord is at hand.
 Practice the Lord&#39;s presence by stopping in the midst of whatever is going on and say, &amp;quot;The Lord is here.&amp;quot;                                              - from Our Daily Bread
 God&#39;s unseen presence comforts me,
    I know He&#39;s always near;
 And when life&#39;s storms besiege my soul,
 He says, &amp;quot;My child, I&#39;m here.&amp;quot;
                          - D. De Haan
 God bless all of you today and may you feel His presence right now this day!
 God bless!

I am humbled Lord at your infinite mercy.  Thank you for &quot;this place.&quot;  Thank you for my sisters, my friends, my life companions.  Cancer is ugly, God.  But we are grateful you can use it to your glory.  For so many blessings I thank you.  Today, especially, I thank you for good pathology reports for Mary and myself.

		<Content>Mothers Day Prayer
Lord Jesus,
You have known a mother&#39;s love
and tender care, and You will hear, while for our mothers most dear, we offer this Mother&#39;s Day prayer.
Protect the lives, we pray, of those who have given us the gift of life
.May our mothers know from day to day the deepening glow of joy that comes from Your presence.
We cannot pay our debts for all the love that we have received; but, You, Lord, will not forget their due reward. Bless our mothers both in earth and heaven.
Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
AMEN

		<Content>Puppy is very concerned about her mammo and MRI next Monday; there are new lumps and she is very worried.  Let us pray that whatever is found is treatable, local, containable, and does not affect her life in a negative way.
Let us pray that these are not malignant, that she has nothing to fear.
Puppy, we are with you each step, don&#39;t worry!!!!

		<Content>Hello Girls....it is so nice to have a thread like this.
I think I should share with you a lady who was a great source of spiritual inspiration to me, and remains with me even though she&#39;s been gone two years now.  She is my husband&#39;s Grandma Callie.
When I first met DH many years ago, he wrote his family about me, and for some reasons which were never made clear to me, they&#39;re weren&#39;t happy with his choice.  His mother was particularly cold, but I got a letter from Grandma Callie, and she told me that she&#39;d always had a great respect for my husband (to-be), and that if he were serious about me, she knew I was special.  She wrote that she meant her letter to be a love letter.
I met her soon after that, I remember how shy I was when we first met, but she gave me a hug right away and we were fast friends ever after.  She was a very spiritual lady, a devout Christian, and through the years the letters came almost weekly.  She told us she was praying for us, and would ask how to pray; we always thought she had a special connection up there, because whatever she prayed for..happened!!!
The last time I talked to her was in June of 2005; she was very ill then, and was refusing medication.  I was begging her to take her medication, but she told me she was not afraid of death, and not to miss her, because we&#39;d meet on the other side.  She passed away a few weeks later. A few months before I was diagnosed with she spoke to me, early morning, just as I was waking, to tell me I was in great danger.


Knowing Grandma Callie and knowing that she is there, on the other side, looking after me, has been a great source of spiritual strength for me through this journey.
I just wanted to share her with all of you....what a special lady!!!

		<Content>Dear MisSizzy,
I&#39;m sorry that you have lost Bunky who was so precious to you. I lost my cat several years ago and I know how empty the house feels when one of our treasured pets dies.  I&#39;m glad that you have such sweet memories of Bunky snuggling with you while you recovered from chemo.  God has blessed us with these wonderful animals who so richly bring joy to our lives. Praying for you as you go through this time of sorrow.
Gentle hugs,
Les-Ann.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you dear sisters for your responses and prayers.  They mean much more to me than you can imagine.
We just had a little funeral service for Bunky with the other cats in attendance.  I petted his luxurious fur for the last time, and he still felt wonderful and cuddilicious.  We just buried him in the same casket with his sister Sissy, who he loved dearly.  It felt so good to put them together, just as they were in the womb before they were born.
Bunky lived a wonderful, long, pampered life, so his death was not tragic, but we will miss him.
Thank you and God bless,
Mizsissy</Content>

		<Content>Dear God, please be with us tonight as we pray for Mena &amp;amp; Puppy and let us hear very positive reports about their medical prognoses.   Now is the time for good news.  They have both had enough in the way of misfortunes and unfair punishment and it is now time to turn the tide and give them the gifts of health and gladness in life, so they may in turn fully give all the wonderful gifts they have to give to others, these two wonderful women who have given so much to all of us here at the breast cancer forum.
Oh dear god, please hear our prayer.

		<Content>Sherry,
Thanks for your kind words it has been a long lesson for me. It is more difficult for men to make the hard decisions with your MIL, I pray you will find wisdom in what is best for your family!
Thanks for all the prayers, I feel your strength as well as His. Knowing you are being praying for is so comforting to me.
It is a pleasure to pray for others too! Funny how you think it would be hard but actually you pray and God does his job!</Content>

		<Content>Debbyfive, thank you for praying for a miracle for me.  I did have a miracle yesterday..a small one but it was one nonetheless, and when it happened (something not directly related to the decisions I&#39;m facing with my MIL), I thought to myself, &quot;thank you Debbyfive, you helped bring me my miracle.&quot;
Kim, I appreciate all your good thoughts and your prayers.  It&#39;s hard to help others when we are facing our own issues, but I&#39;ve found that it becomes easy to put our own concerns aside when someone really needs us.  And one thing I kept stressing to everyone ~ family &amp;amp; friends ~ was that I was still me during active treatment and I was still caring, compassionate and able to help.  I did try to have my husband step up more and do what needed to be done at times when I was tired and laid low from tx, but I must say I am glad that this is now happening when I am at the herceptin stage and living a more settled life.
Cowgirl, I thank you for your prayers and your understanding of what I am facing now.  As you said, we can pray for one another and it is easy to pray for others during our own times of crisis, crossroads, indecision or sorrow and it seems to me that when we pray for one another, our own prayers are heard and answered because of our generous heart and spirit towards others.  What we give comes back to us because we are ready to receive.
We face some hard roads sometimes, but knowing that we have others to help us on the path, to lighten the load and guide us when we feel we&#39;re getting lost, makes the journey that much easier.
The next few weeks will tell the story for me and I&#39;m hoping and praying that my MIL will be receptive to decisions that need to be made, knowing that we are thinking about what is best for her quality of life.</Content>

		<Content>Hi ladies,
I&#39;ve been on vacation and it&#39;s taken me awhile to get caught up (I keep getting bumped off the computer).
I love seeing all of the support here, both in prayers and in word.  I feel like I&#39;ve just arrived at Starbucks and you saved a seat for me on the big comfy sofa!   I&#39;ll have a tall Caramel Macchiato, please!
I, too, have an aging MIL who&#39;s still taking care of herself.  She&#39;s 83.  She&#39;s also caring for my 49 year old SIL who&#39;s mentally challenged (like a 5 yr old or so).  So, we have double decisions to make....eventually.
This past year has been a tough one, what with my bc and my &quot;extra&quot; surgery that wasn&#39;t planned (had a 7cm cyst on one ovary), but all is well for the time being.
In addition, my MIL was in the hospital with a staph infection in her foot and then a month later, my SIL was in the hospital for high BP and possible seizures.  She&#39;s been in and out of both the hospital and rehab hospital since then, but doesn&#39;t seem to be progressing.  As long as my SIL has stabilized and doesn&#39;t get any worse, my MIL will continue taking care of her.  But...if it does get worse, I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to be making 2 decisions.
For now (&amp;amp; it could change any moment), things are fine. I guess we&#39;re all at that age of having aging parents and making difficult decisions.  Btw, Sherry, I too have lost both my parents and my FIL, but it was way before we had to make any difficult decisions.
Sometimes, I just want to be a kid again... well, maybe a college student would be better -- lots of freedom, but not quite so much responsibility.
I just prayed with my daughter tonight and I prayed for you all!  For your difficult decisions, for wisdom, for acceptance, for strength, for hope.
Debbyfive, thank you for reminding each of us to pray!!
Cowgirl, I&#39;ll continue to pray for you, your mom, and your family.  Hang in there, sweetie!!
Sherry, I&#39;ll continue to pray for you, too!  It sounds like you have the right attitude in approaching your situation.  I loved how you said that you wanted strength so you could handle it with grace, dignity, and love.  You truly are &quot;honoring you mother (in-law).&quot;
Deb C. (Alaskadeb) - Praise God that you have completed chemo!!  Congrats!  (I also loved your bunny story - how cute!)
Kim - Praise God for a good MRI!! and that you get to drive!!  We&#39;ll keep praying for your healing.
Carrie, sweet Carrie - Thank you for bringing such warmth &amp;amp; comfort to this thread.  Always love your posts.
Hope you all have a wonderful Sunday!
hugs,
wendy</Content>

		<Content>Wendy, glad to see you back! Hope vacation was restful..I hear you so well on trying to find time on the computer.  With 3 of us (2 teenage boys) wanting on here throughout the day and evening the most common refrain is &quot;are you nearly done?&quot;
And I loved the analogy to Starbucks and pulling up a comfy seat..it is like that here, isn&#39;t?
My thouhghts and prayers are certainly with you regarding your situation with your MIL and your SIL.  As I always say, just when we think our situation is difficult, we hear that someone else is facing something more difficult.  It doesn&#39;t make my situation less or your situation more, it just reminds me that while I think things are difficult for me, my heart goes out to you because your situation is going to require more strength, more love and more compassion.
When the time comes that your MIL is no longer here, you will not only have the situation of deciding on where your SIL will live, who will be her primary caregiver, you will also have the emotional impact on your SIL to work through.  She will miss her mother, quite possibly be confused as to where she has gone, why she has left her...as you would with a child of 5.
Having already dealt with hospitalizations, illnesses, you are already going through some of the stressful, difficult aspect of what lies ahead.  My MIL has her health (so far) though she has been having dizzy spells did fall once, which to my mind sounds more like TIAs (small strokes).  Her doctor is looking at heart as the culprit, I am looking more overall at circulatory so will be pursuing that at her next appointment and paving the way to the decisions that need to be made.  I know that she does not want to live with &quot;other people&quot; as she has said so many times in the past, and yet, it is often what we want the least or fear the most that becomes our destiny.  I remember my mother saying for most of her life that she would hope she&#39;d never be blind..and at the age of 67 developed macular degeneration which rendered her legally blind.
With prayer, love and support for one another here on this board, this thread in particular, I think we will both be able to move forward with strength and love Wendy.  Our compassion and our spirit will dictate that.
I look to the future and know that God willing, I too will be an aging parent and I know that how I approach this situation and handle it will be the example my children have to follow for whatever happens to me and to their father.  I may go first, that is a reality of bc, we face our mortality and make our peace with that.  As my husband is not the stonger of the two when it comes to making decisions, taking action in situations like this, I can ensure that our children will have the knowledge of how to make his final days peaceful if I am not here to do that.
Every experience in life is one of learning and growth. Thank you for sharing your life situation with us.
Hope everyone has a blessed day!</Content>

		<Content>Sherry,
Thanks so much for your wise words.  I hope you&#39;re printing your posts because they are like a journal and would be wonderful to look back on years from now.
As for us, we literally take one day at a time, just like God says in His word.  We can&#39;t worry about the future because we don&#39;t know what is to come (but we can make plans).
I&#39;ve missed the past few weeks at church due to vacation, but I heard that it was wonderful.  I haven&#39;t checked it out yet, but I heard that our pastor spoke on how we can&#39;t worry about what we can control or something like that. I think it sounded very applicable to us here.  Anyway, I can&#39;t wait to hear the tape on it.
Sherry, it&#39;s funny how you mentioned your teenage boys, as my two kids are of that teen and pre-teen age as well.  The only reason I&#39;m on right now is that my son slept over at a friends house last night, and the computer is free.  Ha!
Last night, I tried to post an e-card that I found was quite appropriate to our group here.  I finally got the right link this morning.  So, when you have time, check this out:

Sometimes we think why should we pray? I believe we should because the God who created the universe and everything in it including you and me cares about every minute detail and he wants us to talk to Him.  Here&#39;s one other card/link that reminds me of that:

Actually, all the &quot;music&quot; cards there are pretty neat.  I love all the songs they used. (We even sing some of those including &quot;indescribable&quot; at church).
Btw, our vacation was wonderful.  We went to Colorado for our church&#39;s Family Camp.  We had a blast white-water rafting, hiking, sight-seeing, and just resting.  It was quite a shock coming back to the &quot;over 100 degree&quot; heat here in Texas.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted.
Have a wonderful day,
Wendy</Content>

		<Content>Church today was a blessing.  Our pastor talked all about rest...how we need it, how we all glory in our busy lives and don&#39;t take time to rest in the Lord.  I think he was talking right to me!  He reminded us that all time is the Lords and that he is with us always...just what I needed to hear.
So, I hope all you wonderful ladies take time today to rest in the Lord.  To visit with him and feel his peace.
You are all such a blessing to me!  Thanks for all of you who are praying for my as my surgery date is coming up.
Deb C.</Content>

		<Content>Wendy, thanks for posting those 2 cards..they were beautiful and I&#39;m so glad you introduced us to that site...it&#39;s one I will definitely return to and make use of!  The music is lovely.  I thank you too for your kind words.  I&#39;ve never thought about printing my posts as a form of journalling but you&#39;ve given me a very good idea!  Would certainly be something to go back and reflect on.  One of the benefits of this board...meeting so many intelligent women who present us with thoughts and ideas we might never have had on our own!
Debbyfive, you are always such a delight here with your thoughts of prayer and love and your sense of humour shows itself throughout the board when the occasion calls for it.  Bless you as always on your journey.
Deb C., take care of yourself, rest up and definitely give your worries to the Lord...you are going to have a safe, relaxing trip to Anchorage..please think lovely thoughts on the trip and be good and gentle with yourself during your recovery.  Know that our thoughts and prayers are with you.</Content>

		<Content>Hi all,
Haven&#39;t been around for a while.
Sherry, Cowgirl and Wendy, I see you are all dealing with family members.  It is complex and can be heart wrenching.  The Lord will provide and sometimes we get to do the hard work.
My prayers are with you.
Wendy, the postcards were great.  I really like Chris  Tomlin.  I have never been to that site.
AlaskaDeb I like what you said about &quot;rest in the Lord&quot;.  I need to remember that.  Thank you!

Kim, so great you get to drive.  woohoo
Rest and peace and the Lords love and salvation to all.
Susan</Content>

		<Content>Came back from 3 days in Vermont ~ to give the boys some &quot;good&quot; memories from this summer (last summer was all about breast cancer and we all made memories of a different kind), and spent all day today in the emergency department at the hospital with my MIL who &quot;fainted&quot; and fell to the floor while eating her meal around 11:30.  Husband is still there with her while they finished tests (I came home to feed the boys so they can go to baseball).  If they keep her overnight that will be a good thing; if they send her home, he&#39;ll stay the night for peace of mind for all of us.  The decision to find residence for my MIL (assisted with medical staff) becomes increasingly more urgent I think and I&#39;m hoping she is going to be seeing the need and the common sense of this.  We have no room in either house for the 5 of us to live together and she needs the comfort and assurance of aid 24 hours a day..it is coming to that.
The doctor was most unhelpful (seemed rather uneducated to me as well and I&#39;ve had plenty of experience with doctors over the years) and I was left with the distinct impression both times we spoke that his opinion is &quot;she is nearly 90, what do you expect?&quot;.  At one point he even told me he doubted that she would want surgery if it came to that..I clearly let him know that should it come to that, it would be her informed decision to make.  Other than that he seemed to waffle between letting her go &quot;if she can walk for a bit without feeling dizzy&quot; and keeping her overnight.  He had yet to come to a decision when I left.
It saddens me to think that as we reach our elder years that there is discrimination and &quot;abuse&quot; simply because of &quot;age&quot;.  I feel for that young man and wonder how he is going to feel when it becomes his time and requires geriatric care.  We may become slower, our hearing may deteriorate, our mental capacity may decrease and our vision may go (may? all of those things will happen), but we are still people..with a heart and a soul.  And still deserve to be treated with respect.</Content>

		<Content>Thank you for your kind words Debbyfive...my husband just called to say they are keeping my MIL in hospital overnight.  I think it&#39;s the best place for her at the moment..she is perky now and feeling a little more in control.  We are definitely at a crossroads now and I have prepared my husband and the boys that this could mean a rapid decline in her health, however, anything is possible and she could still be with us for a few more years.  If this is her time and it is God&#39;s wish, that will be the decision.  If he is not ready for her yet, then we will make the most of what time she does have left with us.</Content>

		<Content>Hi all,
I have never visited or posted here...I get too emotional but I am going to start.  I am sitting here with a huge lump in my throat just looking at all the love and care I see here.
Your prayers and inspiration have really lifted my spirits (even with this lump in my throat)and I really needed that as it&#39;s been a rough week.
My prayers are going out to ALL of you tonight.
Sherry...sorry about your MIL...will send a prayer her way too.

		<Content>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found this thread Vickie...even with the lump in your throat.  I think that might just be a sign to you that you feel &quot;at home&quot; here and that&#39;s a good thing.  I find it very comforting in this thread and very uplifting at the same time.  There is a lot of love and compassion on the entire board, but this particular thread is like warm arms and a soft shoulder to curl up in.  You are so welcome here and I hope you will post your thoughts and prayers as well.
Thank you for your kind words and your prayers.  It means a lot to me.  And it&#39;s one of the nicest, kindest things that we can do for one another.
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve had a rough week.  Hopefully tomorrow things will seem brighter and softer for you.

		<Content>Sherry,
We went through what you are going through with your MIL two summers ago with my grandma.  She went back and forth between assisted care and the hospital.  It is a tough road.  My mom and aunt kept fighting all the way for treatment, but after months they finally had to come to terms that their mommy needed to go.  It was extremely difficult for them to finally let go and not treat anymore, just make her comfortable.  I pray that you and your husband know when that time comes.  Prayers for your family.

		<Content>Hi Vicki, nice to see you here.  Sorry you had a bad week.  The next one will be better.
Sherri, it is just so hard dealing with a loved one who&#39;s health is failing.  It just gets so complicated.  Who&#39;s the parent and who&#39;s the child.  What can we do and what should we let go of.  Putting it in God&#39;s hands is easier said than done.  At least it was for me.  I just cried a lot.
Praying for peace and joy for all.
Debbie I really like your enthusiasm.

		<Content>Lini and Susan, thank you for your kind words, care and concern and keeping me in your thoughts.
Kim, I am so sorry to hear about this infection you&#39;ve been fighting and pray that it will leave you and you will be stronger and able to carry on with your treatment.
To all of you who have kept me in your thoughts and prayers, I wanted to say thank you and let you know where things are right now.  My MIL had a fall yesterday ~ she had fainted once before (lost balance for no apparent reason), but this time it was from a sitting position so we went to the hospital to have it checked out.  The simple tests they ran showed no reason for this, other than her advanced age and quite probably lack of hydration which she is very bad about.  We went to see her today and waited for the doctor to make rounds..we saw the doctor who admitted her yesterday, and she was also referred to a geriatric specialist MD for which I was very grateful.  A physiotherapist came to see her to discuss exercises and therapy.
At the end of the afternoon it was decided that my MIL will stay in hospital over the weekend, she will be assessed by the geriatric doctor and the therapist on Monday to determine her level of physical ability and to help her regain some confidence as she is very unsure and shaky about standing &amp;amp; walking at this point.  Her memory is sharp and she is very capable of living alone ~ to this point.   And she is relieved that she is staying in hospital for a few days...I worried that she might want to leave and be in her own house so her relief at staying showed me that she does worry about something more serious happening to her.
Answers come to us when we least expect it, through means we didn&#39;t expect and I do believe that faith and prayer help us to see the answers if we only &quot;look&quot;. This accident was a godsend. The outcome of this will be the option of a homecare worker coming to the house once a week to assist with bathing and other things my MIL would have more comfort in, we are learning about other things to have in the home for her comfort and safety and my MIL is seeing that she can still live on her own with assistance.  This is what we are hoping for.  However, should the doctors decide that she is better off in a nursing home/seniors residence, having shared a hospital room with someone else for a few days will give my MIL the idea of what that would be like (in a home she would have her own room but take meals with others).  Her biggest fear was having to live with &quot;other people&quot;.  She might come to find that she likes the interaction with others rather than being on her own and might well find her house empty and quiet when she returns.  I like that she is being shown &quot;options&quot; which will help down the road when other decisions need to be made.
Thank you once again to all of you...the power of prayer from those who care provides us with the answers when we seek them.</Content>

		<Content>Kathy, I enjoy long posts from you. You always have something good to share, words of wisdom, or in some cases things that crack me up... you remember what your children told you long ago, about winning arguments??? LOL
I bet your heart is so full of pride and love for Katie, it must feel like it&#39;s swollen twice it&#39;s normal size. I know you are concerned about this new transition too, you know what it&#39;s like. I know she must be laughing about the LPN who failed ACLS... not that I dislike LPN&#39;S, I was one first. But, I&#39;ve seen my share of them who seem bent on making new RN&#39;s feel inadequate, trying to beat them down before they manage any self confidence. Katie has your strong will, faith and spirit, you know she will be amazing. Bless her heart.

I am very open to ministering to people with cancer on a one-on-one basis, but I&#39;m not taking time for &quot;causes&quot; right now.
I get it, and agree. I don&#39;t want to think about bc from a clinical standpoint, but I feel so priviledged to meet and take care of various cancer patients as they come thru my unit. It&#39;s such a blessing, and probably a calling for me and you. We love them, and because we&#39;ve lived thru it, we can relate in a whole new way. Just like you said, it&#39;s the one-to-one stuff that we crave.
Guess what?? I just worked, (really worked hard too) for almost 18 hours. I worked 13 and 14 the two nights before. Why am I bragging about this??? Cause God is certainly good, all the time, in every way. Who would believe I could do this??? And I know my butt will be dragging, sore and tired when I get up, but how wonderful to be alive and able to work again, no matter what it takes out of me. LOL I have my first follow up mammo tomorrow.........UGGGHHH but still, am anxious to see the proof (that I know is there) that I am just fine. It&#39;s gonna be such a comfort, hearing those words. Thanks for the lovely post, again, I love the long ones from you, Pat, Caroltine (is she still on mission work?) and anyone else who likes to share their faith and experiences with God. Thanks for being there.
God bless. Rachel</Content>

		<Content>I look for Rachel, Pat, and Caroltina, and always welcome new names to this thread.  I just got through reading Frank Peretti&#39;s book, Monster.  It is very good.  I could not read like that when I was on chemo, but I really got into this one.  My kids are gone to camp this week and I went to lunch with a friend and went to another friend&#39;s house and worked on a quilt.  Now I&#39;m home to fix supper.  Just checking in before I start cooking.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Believe it or not, just warm and balmy so far. It is nice before the tropical storms or hurricanes hit. It feels so warm, and breezy til it gets real close. I was out of town for the first one, Arlene (??) but heard from friends that it wasn&#39;t much at all. Just a bunch of rain and wind. I am not looking forward to Dennis tho, that one sounds like it has so much potential. One thing about hurricanes, it brings out the best and the worst of everyone. And most the time, it&#39;s the best that you see most of. Hurricane Ivan, when I think back to the day (s) right after it hit, I get teary eyed. So many people going out of their way to be kind to others, giving, sharing their homes, just showing up and cutting down the fallen trees out of a neighbors yard, or so many times it was a total stranger doing an act of total kindness, anonmously. I can&#39;t spell. LOL One morning, we woke up and found our associate pastor out in the mud, in the back yard, putting our fence back up. It was around 6 in the morning, just found him there. It&#39;s things like that, that leave you with a great sense of community. We saw hundreds of trucks from other states, coming down to help get our power, water, phone lines back up. Of course, they couldn&#39;t get to us for a couple days, but it was just a beautiful sight. It happened a few days after my first dose of A/C,and I was so scared, and so sick.  Too sick to evacuate, truly. But, by staying, I was amply blessed. Just had to say this, rambling on. Thanks for asking. NPat is down here next to me too. What goes east of me, hits her area. Hope Dennis sputters out and hits nobody.</Content>

		<Content>Hi, gals!
We, got a few bursts of showers today... I gotta share what happened on the 4th. I invited my neighbor... also one of my patients to our barbeque. We had just finished eating when he bacame diaphoretic and ashen. Long story shortened... became unconscious and I couldn&#39;t get a BP. He has a pacemaker so there was an apical pulse. My husband called 911 and ran outside to make sure the ambulance wouldn&#39;t pass the house. My mom took our Shih Tzu and disappeared(?) My 92 year old dad was the only one who stayed with me as he leaned on his cane and said,&quot;Can I get you a cold cloth?&quot; I was talking to God and said, &quot;OK, God, I KNOW you allowed this to occur and are going to give me wisdom.&quot; I just had an umbilical hernia repair 10 days before and couldn&#39;t move my neighbor who was out cold at the dining room table. All I could do was talk to him and reassure him that I was there for him even though it appeared he could not hear me. The EMT&#39;s got there in about 7 minutes (like I wasn&#39;t timing them!). Anyway, he responded to emergency measures and I was able to speak with him about the Lord in the ER. I was keenly aware that God was in the mix of this. My husband and parents said after I got back from the hospital that night that it was obvious that I was in the right field and my profession was my ministry... I have to agree. I love what I do and have been so keenly aware of the doors that God has opened. He really seems to provide opportunities when we show love and concern for others regardless of their personal circumstances. Because of the BC experience this past year, now there are others who have been faced with cancer that are able to speak with me about their fears... so far there are two fellow church members with prostate cancer. God has allowed me to use the wisdom gained from my experience and use it to encourage others... wow, I am so awed by how He transforms our trials into treasure! Blessings!

		<Content>Hello all,
What a story, Pat!  That was awesome.  Just shows who is in charge of life and death, again.  I agree that you have found your calling.
I have to confess that I let the devil get a hold of me yesterday and I was in a snit most of the day.  I now regret that because my kids are at camp for the week and I was home alone and wasted a day!  I feel much better after talking with my husband about the issue.
For a while now, ever since we read The Purpose Driven Life as a church, I think it was 03, but with chemo brain who really knows, I have desired to have friends that were not Christian.  I have surrounded myself and my kids with Christians for a good influence on them, but I need to be a little more evangelical in a relationship way.  Well, I went to the Y this morning after procrastinating, and ran into a couple of people I used to play tennis with.  One of them I see fairly often at church, but the other one is Jewish.  I found out that they meet at the Y a couple of mornings a week to work out.  I gave them my number and I think we will be playing tennis soon.  I am really excited as I have always liked playing with them and the time we spent talking between games and sets.
It feels so good to get back in the swing of life.  I will be supervising a friend&#39;s son in the mornings when school starts back.  She home schools, but her husband weirded out and left the family.  She is working and does not want her son to be left alone that many hours.  It will work great as he is in the 7th grade and I have 9th and 11th going on anyway.  I also want to check into being a mentor at an elementary school close to our church.  I have had a burden to help kids learn to read for several years and have not felt the outlet to do that until now.  I could do that a couple of afternoons a week.
Rachel and Pat, hope you guys stay safe and dry.  Caroltina is still in Mexico I guess.  Thanks for letting me ramble.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Caroltina is home from Mexico!  What can I say?  There is too much to say.  It was a joy to be in our home in Mexico, to see everyone who had missed us greatly, and thought they would never see us again.  We worked so hard while there, cleaning our place up, cleaning out our stuff, visiting people, working on our cars, etc.  It was over 100 degrees most days, and 105 degrees in the shade a couple of days.  It felt good to sweat, though, really did.  We brought back all four pets, which is: our old calico cat, with a huge absess on her neck(I&#39;ve put Bag Balm on it and expect that today it will open up and drain); our big, beautiful dustygray cat; our dachshund; and our big mix breed Mexican dog. God blessed us and kept all our animals very calm on our trip home.  Our special needs boy, Marcos, enjoyed his time in Mexico, spent time in the water almost every day, in our little quickset pool there, and just seemed to enjoy being there, even though it was hot.  We had two church services while there.  I shared for both of them, and what I shared really touched the hearts of those present, which was 20 people the first Sunday, and 30 the next.  From our little itsy bitsy community, that&#39;s a lot of people.  I made people cry, as I shared about the sovereignty of God, and how that I had all but lost my faith in God, in heaven, in everything, until I put aside my own thoughts and feelings, and decided to give credibility to God&#39;s word, over my feelings and thoughts, and to cry out to Him, talk to Him, tell Him everything I was feeling, and trust Him to hear me.  I told how that I had felt unacceptable to Him, because of the sense of my own sinful nature and unworthiness, should I die, to go to heaven.  And that then I saw, that it isn&#39;t my worthiness that gives me the right of entrance into heaven, but because He paid the price for my sins, and my trust in Him as my savior, that is what gives me the right to a relationship with Him, and to join Him when I do die, for all eternity.  It was good.  I love those people down there, and they love us.  I got so many hugs and kisses on my cheeks, real loving ones.  People there were very worried about us, and so glad to see us both alive.  We plan to go back in December and begin finishing what we&#39;ve begun, and hopefully start on a project to build a building where eye surgeries can be done there.
My energy level went from having just a little, to really having super energy by the time we left.  I am all suntanned, and have a white stripe across my foot, from where my sandals were.  My arm swelled quite a bit, but no major crisis or anything.  I went around much of the time without wearing a bra, just a tank top and shorts, and wasn&#39;t embarrassed.  It was just too hot to worry about it, and the elastic in my bra made my arm swell worse in the heat.  The kids there, who swam in our pool most every day, didn&#39;t act weird to me for not having boobs, and the people in the community didn&#39;t either.  They are our friends, like family.
Anyway, it&#39;s good to be home, I think, to this home.  We really feel like this is just one home, and that the other one is just as real, and the other family, too, just as real.  I so praise God for allowing me to go there, as I feared I&#39;d never be going back there.  Now for the work, of doing what we need to here, and of making the contacts and connections we need to make in order to be able to move forward with new ideas for there in Mexico.  My head feels a bit in a whirl.  I am going to have to remind myself moment by moment to take one step at a time.
Anyway, I want to know what major things have happened since I&#39;ve been gone, on the board here.  Any real interesting happenings?  New treatments, new discoveries on cancer, anything?
Guess I&#39;d better go check my e-mail and answer them.

Pat, it&#39;s the best part of the whole bc experience isn&#39;t it? There is so much good that can come from our bc, and it&#39;s so beautiful when we see it in action. It&#39;s like God has given me an overwhelming love for the cancer patients I see at work. It is clearly from God, and it makes me feel like I&#39;m really alive, really have a purpose when I am filled with that love. I know when you were with your neighbor you could feel the Lord right there with you, the same way. It&#39;s amazing. How is your neighbor? and how are you after Dennis? Just hoping to hear from you soon.
Caroltina-great to hear from you and your trip to Mexico sounds wonderful. Did you notice what you typed? You went to help others, and came back tanned and with more energy than you&#39;d had in awhile. God certainly blesses us when we least expect it. I&#39;m so glad you are feeling better.
Kathy-thanks for your prayer during the last week. It made a huge difference, that I truly believe.</Content>

		<Content>Just checking in.  Caroltina, I&#39;m glad you are back from Mexico; sounds like you had a fabulous time.  Looks like you actually have two homes and a difficult choice each time you leave one for the other.
Rachel, glad to hear that you are safe and sound.  Have you heard from Pat?  We got rain Friday night and today.  Sure cooled things off and was a welcome relief!
God bless your day!

		<Content>Kathy, I haven&#39;t heard from or seen Pat on the boards. I hope she&#39;s just real busy, which I&#39;m sure she is. Is Waco on the West side of Texas?? I hope so, it looks like Emily is coming that way. And I&#39;m praying it slows down some before it makes landfall, it&#39;s a catagory 4, and probably will increase while it goes across the gulf. Keeping everyone in that direction in my thoughts, especially Mexico. They aren&#39;t in much better shape than Cubans. So much poverty there, and probably no good shelters. Does the Red Cross go to Mexico? Caroltina do you know? Just curious about that, what kind of comfort stations they might have, that&#39;s what they call it here. Ice, cases of bottled water, tarps and MRE&#39;s. We thought we had hit Christmas last year, with the MRE&#39;s. They are amazing. Really. Like kids in a toy store, trying to figure out how they work, and looking to see how each one is different. LOL</Content>

		<Content>Rachel,
Waco is right in the middle of Texas - deep in the heart of Texas.  We get rain if the hurricanes hit around Galveston, but nothing more.  We do have tornadoes sometimes and hail and high winds.  I was in our surburban several years ago with my kids when bad weather hit.  The wind blew the traffic light arm around 90 degrees and a huge piece of corrugated sheet metal was flying around my windshield.  I had the kids to get unbuckled and lie on the floor.  My son said, &quot;I think we need to pray!&quot; and my daughter replied, &quot;What do you think I&#39;ve been doing?&quot;  They were 8 and 5 and I had a baby in the car seat.  We had just a few blocks to get to the pizza place where we were going and we made it.  I didn&#39;t notice that the back windows of the surburban were broken until I was taking them to school the next morning.  We were caught in a downdraft and the pressure change shattered the glass.  Was pretty scary, but exciting.  That&#39;s my weather story.
My husband and I are home alone!  My son turned 21 on the 12th and we had a party for him on Friday  night.  My daughter, Katie, came home for the weekend, too.  Katie and her roommate left earlier this afternoon, Kinsey (16) went with friends to get ice cream, Kirsten  (14) is spending the night with friend, and Keller (21) just left to go back to his house.  Our life group just dismissed, too.  The kitchen is cleaned and I&#39;m on the boards, again!  Busy weekend!
God bless your day!

		<Content>Hi-I am new to this Spiritual/Christian thread but so grateful there is such.  The Lord has so sustained me and kept me in peace through it all (masectomy; 13 positive lymph nodes; chemo (2 different times); radiation.  Now am on Arimidex (for 7 months) and starting to enjoy life once again.</Content>

		<Content>Jeano,
Welcome.  I also had lymph involvement, 14+ out of 14, stage 3, grade 3.  Surgery September 13, 2004.  I&#39;m all done with everything, (bilateral mastectomy - no reconstruction, chemo, and radiation) and it&#39;s great to be alive, great to have learned from this, that God is God, and I am not, and that He is faithful to use everything that comes my way, for good - that I can trust Him.  I had a rough time, at times, keeping perspective through treatment, but that&#39;s behind me.  Now I&#39;m energized and ready to go.  No noticeable side effects from Arimidex.  Have a goal to walk at least 30 minutes a day, but have been not keeping up to that goal very well recently.  Nice to hear from you, and of the peace God has given you.

		<Content>Welcome, Jeano!  It is good to have a place to talk freely about the goodness of God.  He has been faithful to see me through this ordeal.  His promise to prosper me and not to harm me and to give me a hope and a future are coming true everyday.
Hello, Caroltina; glad to have you back.
Has anyone heard from Hope?  I haven&#39;t seen her post in a long time.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Hi, sisters!
I have been doing well... just a bit busy. Was out of town when Dennis hit and came back to no electricity. All is well now. We were able to get a generator from Lowes and saved our refrigerated and frozen foods. We were especially busy at the office and did some work at home... so didn&#39;t get to post as often as I like.
I had another God Thang happen today. My husband and I were in a hospital waiting room with a friend whose husband was having surgery as a result of prostate cancer. In walks some former fellow church members who moved away because of a call to the ministry. After the initial greetings we discovered that he is a pastor in the small town to which our daughter and son-in-law just moved. Their son is a student at the university where our son-in-law will be teaching.... God is the God of details. He cares about every inch of our being... because He made us!
We have all been called to a ministry and I find it so exciting to discover how God confirms our calling when He reveals himself! While in the waiting room today, I heard fellow church members discuss what was going on in their lives... they were becoming guardian ad litems, doing &quot;prayer walks&quot; (visiting local schools, nursing homes, etc) and circling the buildings in prayer, beginning to step out in faith when the Lord prompted them, going on missionary trips... None of these individuals were employed in a ministry... many were retired and on a fixed income. The Pink Lady shared as she left that she had been watching our motley group interact and was reminded of the time her church gathered around her when her husband was ill and helped the time pass in the waiting room... he later died. We invited her to worship with us. She coyly said, &quot;If I WERE a Methodist, I would definitely worship with you!&quot; The truth is... we have come from varied backgrounds and have had a variety of life experiences... Our denominational ties are not the most important issue but our relationship with our Lord IS.
What a knack our God has in bringing us together... Look at this discussion board. We are so different... but together in the same family! If this were left up to man... it wouldn&#39;t happen!
I have rambled enough... I need to say, &quot;Good night!&quot; Be blessed this week!

		<Content>Welcome Jeano, glad you have found this thread, feel free to jump in, and talk away. We love reading whatever someone feels inspired to write. LOL
Pat, so glad you are just busy and not having a health problem or a Hurricane related problem. So, you were without power??? How far and wide Dennis stretches, I was without power too, and the people in Santa Rosa county were hit hard. You and I live 2 hours apart, at least, and we both were suffering the same effects of Dennis. Just think how wide spread it could have been, like Ivan, last year. We were blessed in this one, no doubt about it. I am thinking of those in the path of Emily and prayer that they will be safe, and the Hurricane will slow down drastically before landing in Mexico/Texas boarder. Caroltine, glad you&#39;re not traveling during this nasty weather. And it sounds like you were totally energized while you were in Mexico. Isn&#39;t it a blessing, when we are doing for others, we (unknowingly) gain so much in the process. Pat, God is all around you, that&#39;s for sure. He is faithfully providing for your family.</Content>

Thank you for openly expressing your faith in Jesus Christ.  I am also a believer and I am facing a year of full-time teaching on the 16th of this month.  I will pray for you and ask you to pray for me.  I am new to the discussion boards, so if I mess up, help me out.  I am used to the chat rooms, but they won&#39;t let me in for some reason today.  Thanks for the encouragement!</Content>

		<Content>Olive2,
Glad you found us! My heart goes out to teachers! You have so many additional duties and family situations are so complex these days! You have the opportunity to be a daily testimony of God&#39;s love. There are so many kids out there that need an adult who is a role model. We are overcome with meth labs in this area and the number of children in the welfare system has skyrocketed. I was at the Salvation Army Thrift store today to see if they had a larger desk our son could use. It was packed with families getting school clothes. I must say... I thought, &quot;Hmm, would MY children be as eager to hunt through these racks?&quot; I had a sense of shame that I had so much and that I really needed to be more thankful. I could shop elsewhere if I wished... but many of the other customers couldn&#39;t. I am not a &quot;label freak&quot; and have tried to teach our children that the only label that really counts is the one on our heart... &quot;Jesus&quot;.

		<Content>Hello, Roxwooood, are you there?
I read a very old entry you made, saying you need to start making the habit of walking.  So, have you been walking?  You know, I started that section on &quot;walking moments&quot; and it went pretty good for a while.  Lots of people commented.  Then stopped.  And, I haven&#39;t been being faithful at all to walk.  Oh, I do a little, maybe three times a week.  Just want to know how you are doing with that, as it was something you thought you should do.  And any others here.  I&#39;m feeling really fat right now.  Have gained about 5 pounds recently.  Ugh.  No excuse!  I have my dog now!  Actually, two of them.  Rrrr.  Let&#39;s encourage one another.

		<Content>Dear Sisters in Jesus,
I was just on the edge of my seat reading about how you look to the Lord for strength and comfort!  Where can one go when life looks dark and health is going downhill?  Doctors cannot cure you, money is of no help, friends have no time, but we have one who is closer than a brother to us-Jesus!  Oh what a comfort we have in Him.  When we call out to Him He hears us and sends us His peace.  He has helped me down pills when my throat was dry as a bone and fight when I was down and out with treatment.  We must keep our eyes fixed on Him and our minds on Him.  Yes, He will give you a song in the night.  A song when the days are dark.  And one day s song that will praise Him forever
Love and prayers for you!  Sandy</Content>

		<Content>Hello All,
I am just checking in to catch up with you guys.  I am not on the boards as much as I used to be.  Are any of you involved with the Katrina evacuees?  Our SS class took a collection and I volunteered to coordinate food for a family of 12 that is in Waco.  Our teenagers got involved and we had 8 teens in our kitchen this afternoon making cole slaw, baked beans, potato salad, broccoli-rice casserole, rolls, and getting the brisket marinating.  They really worked well and had fun, too.  Some of them made cookies in another home yesterday as well.  It is so good to see your kids getting involved with spreading God&#39;s love.  My husband has been teaching recently that what makes God&#39;s love perfect is when we receive it and pass it around to the rest of His children.
Just to check in - I have lost a total of 30 pounds!  I have been walking and continuing to work out some.  I am so excited to be wearing shorts and dresses that I have not worn in YEARS!  Just gave away the &quot;fat&quot; clothes tonight to a sister who can wear them.
How are you Rachel, Pat, Caroltina, Sandy, Inspie and the other new ones?  Let&#39;s not let this thread die.
God bless your day!

		<Content>Hi, I am a survivor!! Yippee!! It has been a challenging month. My elderly parents live with us (83 and 92). Mom has been hospitalized twice, our daughter had our first grandbaby and the office has been very busy.... plus a lot of other issues. However, God is in control and I am learning more and more to listen to His voice as I am prompted by the Holy Spirit. If only I had learned to listen sooner... anyway. Breast cancer has a way of rearranging priorities. I am doing well... all my check-ups were good and this trial has certainly given me more wisdom. I love ya&#39;all.

		<Content>Congratulations Pat! on the new baby and being a survivor of bc, as well as the other stuff you&#39;ve been slammed with!  It&#39;s so hard to remember our lessons, from one time to the next. I know what you mean, it&#39;s like whew! I get it! I get it! I get it! and the light bulb goes off over our heads, and we realize we&#39;ve been relearning the same lesson over and over. God sure is patient with us! Once you climb over that mountain, and see the other side, it&#39;s so beautiful, and you feel so blessed. Glad to hear from you.</Content>

		<Content>I&#39;ve brought this back to the top because I&#39;m thinking of bluekitten/Kathy. I was looking for some of her old posts from this site, I don&#39;t know why . I guess I miss reading her wisdom and faith. I am thinking of copying and saving a bunch of her old posts that meant so much to me. They will soon disappear, since we are limited to how long we can go back in time. (wish they&#39;d fix that option, I don&#39;t care how much it would slow down my search results). If anyone else would like me to PM them a copy of Kathy&#39;s posts that I found the most touching, let me know, I&#39;ll be glad to do so. I remember not long before Kathy was found to have mets, she told me she missed my postings in the spiritual/christian thread, asked me if I had any more God stories. You know, I had some, just too busy, too lazy to post them for her. I didn&#39;t call Kathy when I should have, before she died. I regret how much I procrastinated before she died. Her life and death was not in vain, she touched so many of us, and will touch so many more.</Content>

		<Content>Here&#39;s a PM Kathy sent me Oct. 7, 2005. You know what I take from this PM? Kathy&#39;s joy with life, and God&#39;s beautiful timing!! Kathy finished that quilt right before being diagnosed with mets. She completed her goal and entered it into a fair. It brings tears to my eyes when I re-read this. What an angel Kathy was, and continues to be in heaven.
&quot;take some ibuprofen, you&#39;ll feel better&quot;

From: bluekitten

Rachel,
I went to my FP for the fever thing because it happened this week. It was very frustrating because my DH was off work and we were going to work on the house. I&#39;m getting a new kitchen and the cabinets are and needed staining and finishing. Well, I was puny and laid around and my sweetie stained the cabinets. I told the Dr. that I didn&#39;t think he would find anything wrong and I probably just came to whine. He did a CXR which was good and a sed rate, CBC, and UA. I don&#39;t have those results yet. Then he said he wanted me to take ibuprofen 3 X day for two weeks. I had to chuckle to myself because my daughter, Katie, the nurse, used to say, &quot;That&#39;s all you ever say when I&#39;m sick. &#39;Take some ibuprofen, you&#39;ll feel better.&#39; I could be dying, and that&#39;s all you would say!&quot;
Well she got a laugh when I told her what he said. I feel fine when I take it and we&#39;ll see what happens.
Sounds like you are WAY busy now. Do you have any more God stories? They were so encouraging.
I got the quilt finished that my mother started 50 years ago and entered it in our fair. We&#39;re going tonight and I&#39;ll see if I got a ribbon. I read the criteria VERY carefully and it did not say anything about when the quilt was started, just that it had to be finished in 2005 and quilted by the exhibitor. Anyway, that was a goal I made when I was first dx&#39;d, and I am alive to tell it!
God bless your day!

		<Content>Rachel,
Kathy knew your heart, at the end there was no talking to her. From the day I saw her on 12/17 till her death she went very quickly. She had Christmas with her kids, celebrated another anniversary and told her kids and her DH what she felt she needed to.
So take comfort that Kathy did the things that were so special to her! That quilt she was so proud of! She said she had closure on it. But there was no way to know how quickly Kathy would go down, and you can only blame this horrific disease for that!
Her kitchen is being finished by her family, she had already picked out everything she wanted to go in it. So they have that project together to do, which I think will help them.
Funny how her legacy was a mission. Her memorial was filled with people that knew her faith or were affected by her faith. She did not to do any activity to fulfill her mission but be her God Loving God Fearing self.
She was an angel among us, and as her friend take comfort that you knew her love and heart first hand. There is no greater gift than love!
Rest easy Rachel, He is in control!</Content>

		<Content>Thank you ladies, so much. Kathy knew I cared, that&#39;s true. Like you said Cowgirl, she went so incredibly fast! She lived fully, right til the very end. I am glad to hear they are working on the kitchen, doing it as she would have done. Her legacy will live forever, in us, her family and the &quot;real time&quot; friends. Thank you for your support, and kind words, they mean so much.</Content>

		<Content>I know one thing for sure, age doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.  The young and the old get this awful disease.  It strikes the people in the best of health and those vegetarians (Linda McCarthy) and the ones who seem to do all the things right.  I got my shocker when I was 49.  I was in good shape, ate right, didn&#39;t drink, had a baby and breast fed , and tried to live a healthy life style.  There was nothing that I did that caused this.  Never took drugs, or even a birth control pill.  But I look on the positive side of how much I have grown and become even closer to my Lord Jesus through it all.  Now I lean totally on HIm and know that I am here on this journey to help others get through what I went through.  To encourage you that good days are ahead, better health or there is an unimaginable home up in heaven.  I stand at the bedside of dying people and look into their eyes and try to tell them to not lose heart.  This life here on earth is temporary and people who get caught up in the outward appearance and money are not wise.  It is not about that stuff.  It is about helping and comforting people and walking to the best of our ability here so we can hear &quot;Well done my good and faithful servant.  You have been faithful in a few things, come and enter into glory.&quot;:  That is my goal. Sandy</Content>

		<Content>I was diagnosed on my 58th birthday..five years ago. I had a lumpectomy, six months of CMF then they found a lump they had missed all along and it too was cancerous so I had a mastectomy. I had many problems because the chemo caused liver damage. Then at the two year mark they found a lump in my other breast. It was atypical hyperplasia. I had the lumpectomy. I started after the mast. with tamoxifen and switched to arimidex after a year. It took me four years to get back to normal life</Content>

		<Content>I was 48 when I was diagnosed.  It was just last fall, in fact.  I am very lucky that I had my mammogram when I did.  The one cancer was tiny and was confined to a milk duct.  It hadn&#39;t spread at all and was non-invasive.  After the lumpectomy I had six weeks of radition therapy.  Hopefull, now I&#39;m cancer free.  I go back for a follow-up next week.</Content>

Mine was IDC, Stage 1, nothing on the mammogram the year before but i guess i have REALLY REALLY dense breasts as everyone I have met in the last few months seems to tell me so its hard to see the bc... now in treatment and then hopefully all is well.... best....

		<Content>I&#39;m 49 and dx Aug 29th. My tumor was not seen on mammo or US in 05&#39; OR this yr. The calcs they saw and bx&#39;d were ADH, and luckily had to have exc. bx because the stereo core bx failed. I think that came from above. At any rate, my exc. revealed IDC in part of the margin. I have to go back and re-excise or do mast. Dr wants mast, maybe bilat. because of my occult tumor and the density of both breasts and many bilat. bx&#39;s. I am getting bilat. MRI on the 14th, will know more then. I am leaning towards mast. but have other serious health conditions that warrant much decision making on my part. Will be praying for you all.

		<Content>Turned 50 in May. Because of the publicity surrounding Katie Couric and her colonoscopy I realized that I should stop being so cavalier about my health. Made appt for mammo, ob-gyn, internist, dentist, etc. First thing was the mammo - it was  only by the grace of God that this was found as early as it was. I suppose I should write Katie and thank her - she wasn&#39;t touting BC but she was promoting taking better care of yourself. Something that I, as a nurse, have been pretty lax about.</Content>

		<Content>I was 34 when first dx - not sure what stage had dozens maybe hundreds of tiny tumors - some invasive. I had a modified radical mastectomy and the nodes were negative. I think I was treated aggresively - 6 months CMF, then 3 months Adriamycin. That was 12 years ago and I was diagnosed with bone and liver mets in June 2006. Currently undergoing chemo of Abraxane and Carboplatin, also Zometa for my bones - will continue until it&#39;s either stable or gone!</Content>

		<Content>Glad to see another Senior in the postings. I was dx in Aug 06. I am 71. Had a lumpectomy in Aug and nodes are clear but cancer in the margin. The remaining cancer is on the opposite side if the two cancers that were removed, so they are thinking that it is a &quot;residue&quot; from the biopsies I had, so I am going with another lump. You may be thinking at my age why not a mast? Well, they&#39;ve been around a long time and I&#39;d like to keep them a bit longer.
Actually, recurrence has the same chance with either lump or mast in my case. Largest one was 2cm and stage IIa for ILC.</Content>

4 AC 4 Taxol 5 years tamox
Mine had managed to grow 1.5cm in the 1 month it took to do all the testing on it. Core biop came back clear. But My doc knew as soon as he seen the consistency of it that it was cancer. He pretty much insisted it be removed. I had a lumpectomy that came back pos. followed by a double mas (my choice)</Content>

		<Content>I am 49, was dx&#39;ed 8/24, DCIS Stage 3.  Had lumpectomy and SNB, nodes clear. Rads begins on 10/5, 33 treatments ending 11/20.
For some reason surgeon didn&#39;t order hormone testing.  Medical oncologist has requested it now so when we know if ER/PR pos or neg we will talk more about Tamoxifen.  From what I know right now about side effects and the slight change in recurrence percentages, I have already decided that I will probably decline.  But of course I will consider all options available when the time comes to make a decision.</Content>

		<Content>Colton01 - I&#39;m doing pretty well - responding to the treatment and most of the pain is gone. I have better mobility now too.
I had a limp from my left hip and had a hard time twisting my trunk and arms around to reach. Both have subsided with 3 treatments. My markers are down 600+ points so far. Still have a ways to go but I think that&#39;s remarkable for only 3 treatments.
I&#39;m off the pain meds and only take ibuprofen when I overdo it. I&#39;m now walking and doing yoga mildly to regain some strength and flexibility (and bring my rear end back up where it belongs!). Frankly, I feel better now than I have since January - when the pain started before I knew what it was!
Thank you so much for asking - there is hope for mets!!!</Content>

		<Content>12 days after I turned 48.  Happy Birthday!  So far lumpectomy, 9mm IDC, er/pr+, her2-, no lymphatic invasion suspected but having a SNB in a few weeks to be sure.  Dense cystic breasts.
I asked the surgeon today how long he thinks this thing was inside me, based on having taken it out and what he knows from my path report.   He said 5-6 years!  Amazing.  And it was not detected in 2003 when the Fibroadenoma next to it was discovered by my very on-the-ball and thorough radiologist.  Who knows if it was overlooked or simply not large enough yet then to be read in a mammo or ultrasound, and obviously since it didn&#39;t show up in those diagnostic methods an MRI, which possibly might have picked it up, was not indicated.  Sort of a Catch-22 here.
And yet they are still saying this was caught early!  How something that&#39;s been in me for 5-6 years before it was detected can be considered &quot;catching it early&quot; is anyone&#39;s guess but whatever.  I wish I could turn back the hands of time.  I wonder what I was doing the day it &quot;was born&quot; - I&#39;m been contemplating a lot lately if this could have somehow been caused by stress (5-6 years ago coincides with a VERY stressful period of my life on many fronts) or if it&#39;s Ye Olde Basic Crapshoot O&#39;Life.
Indeed, weird about all these birthday diagnosis.  It would have been a few weeks later but I couldn&#39;t stand the suspense and made an appointment with the radiologist who could see me sooner.  It still would have been a lousy birthday present, just slightly more belated.</Content>

		<Content>I stopped nursing on may 28 &#39;05, and in june saw my gp about a (?) clogged duct. Got a second opinion, and since I had been nursing for 16 mths, and was 33, we agreed to keep an eye on it. After all, it was oblong-not your typical round lump! Needless to say a lumpectomy a week after my 34th bday revealed a 5cm tumor, followed by a mastectomy to the left breast in september (2 out of 22 nodes +), 4ac,4 taxol starting late oct., and i am now starting my 4th week of radiation. I have posted on another board regarding the area; chest wall, under arm and super clav-4 areas total being treated. Funny to think i was excited to end nursing to have my smaller chest size back!</Content>

		<Content>I was 25 when I was diagnosed. I waited until a few days after my 25th birthday before I went to see the doctors as I wanted to focus on my party. I had a lump on my left breast for ages but because I had never heard of anybody the age I was getting breast cancer I just ignored it and thought it was just a cyst. I thought it was just something that older women had to worry about as there wasn&#39;t any education out there for women my age. It was a terrible shock to me and all of my family as there is no family history of it either...guess these things have to start somewhere. My daughter was 3 at the time of my diagnosis and she is going to be 12 this year so I am thankful that I have been able to be here for as long as I have as it has now spread to my bones and time is of the essence. My thoughts and prayers go out to all of you incredible people who are dealing with this terrible disease. Keep ya chin up!!</Content>

		<Content>Had just turned 42 (maybe a lot of us have our physicals around our b&#39;days?), and was a newlywed, married 4 /2 months when diagnosed w/invasive on the left and DCIS on the right in August 2004.  Had bi-lateral lump&#39;s, clear nodes and radiation on the left.  Considered, but didn&#39;t have chemo, as we wanted to try for a family (we gave my body four months to recuperate after 38 days of radiation ended in Dec 2004).
Two weeks after a miscarriage, I discovered a lump that was later confirmed to be recurr bc in Dec 2005.  This was despite an allegedly clean mamm in Oct 2005, that was &quot;lost&quot; when I went for 2nd opinions in Jan 2006. Just this week, as I&#39;m going for 2nd opinions on treatment now, they included the (missing) mamm&#39;s and as I suspected, they MISSED A SUSPICIOUS SPOT in the exact location of the bc that even I could detect!  Also, my request for a CT Scan in Oct 2005 was denied; but when I asked after the recurr bc was confirmed, got it ... and was shocked and devastated to learn that I have mets to the liver and possible renal cell carcinoma.
So, I&#39;m now 43, on chemo, on a medical leave from work, figure a child will not be possible, and am trying to stay healthy, doing a ton of research on bc, including 2nd opinions and discussing everything with my oncologist.

		<Content>Hi, 49 here. Had biopsy with no clear margins so went for left mast., chemo &amp;amp; hormonals. Took Arimidex for about 9 mos. and was really hit hard by serious side effects like trouble breathing &amp;amp; severe bone pain &amp;amp; muscle weakness so I quit about a month ago. Feel better already and am walking a mile and a 1/2 every day again. Still have weakness but its getting better.  Love to all, Faerychild</Content>

		<Content>I was diagnosed late February at age 50.  DCIS/LCIS low grade 2.9 cm.  I had a lumpectomy, then a recision for cleaner margins and am starting radiation next week.  Still undecided on tamoxifin.  Mine was found during a routine mammography and was not able to be felt by me or my gyn, or the surgeon.  Thank goodness for mammograms.  I had no symptoms but in hindsight my nipple was hypersensitive for six months prior.

I am stronger than I thought I ever could be.  Hugs to all of you.</Content>

		<Content>I was diagnosed on 1/18/06, 2 months after my 48th. My mom and aunts around 60.  Now they tell my daughter is looking at around 40.  I did have a stereotactic 3 years prior that came back negative, but I think this was a precursor.  I had annual mammos and was very fortunate that they were  able to find the 4mm tumor with clean margins as it never showed up on tons of mammos, only calcifications.  Went forward anyway with a bilateral as it was ILC and didn&#39;t want to worry about it showing up next door.  Turns out the other breast had LCIS.  All of you really young women on these boards give me hope for my 21 year old daughter.  I&#39;m sure that if she has to follow our same path, she&#39;ll be just as strong as you. I keep telling myself and hope and pray that she never has to come our way. I will continue to pray for all of us....</Content>

Whenever my husband asks me what I want for my b&#39;day I cry.  My next chemo is 4 days before my 50th.  I am hoping to feel decent enough to go out to dinner with my husband and kids.</Content>

		<Content>I was 59.5 -- screening mammography.  Had them all done with the same medical group for about 10 years.  Saw the film for the last four years before diagnosis -- I demanded all my films.  Breast surgeon showed me where it was on the previous ones.  They had missed it until it got to 4.5 cms -- still non-palpable.  Low grade, lazy tumor growing away -- no nodes. But, to be fair, he said that he knew where to look.
Ladies, your mammography is only as good as the person(s) doing it and the person(s) READING it.  Even before the surgery, I could never feel it.
61 and looking forward to retirement.

		<Content>I was 43 (Dec, 2004), am now 44.  My first mammogram showed micro calcifications on the left side and I had to have a biopsy back in 2000.  Nothing showed up on the first biopsy, but I would always complain every year about pain (scar tissue) in that area even after having normal mammograms.  I went back again for my yearly complaint and the doc said to have a mammogram.  This one showed up suspicious on the right side.  I was dx with stage 2, 1.2cm, 1 node positive in December, 2004. Chemo started in Feb and I?m now half way through, looking forward to the end.</Content>

		<Content>Hi I&#39;m Heather,
 I was 28 yrs old when I was first told I had IDC, I&#39;m now 29.  Many think that since I&#39;m young its easier to handle but I disagree. 
 I never even heard of someone at my age having something like this, when some found out they didnt believe it was possible.  After research I know many do.
 I love coming to this website whether I&#39;m young or not, because everyone here has been more than helpful</Content>

		<Content>I was 31 the first time I was diagnosed with Stage II IDC.  My son turned 1 the weekend I found out, and sat with me all through my treatments.  I thought I was finished for good with bc, but I was rediagnosed last summer at age 46.  I can tell you it&#39;s not easy at any age.  When you&#39;re younger you think of all the things you haven&#39;t done yet, and when you&#39;re older you wonder if you&#39;ll be around to finish the things you&#39;ve started.  It&#39;s been harder on my family this time -- my kids are teenagers and understand more of what is happening, and of course feel it&#39;s all about how this impacts them -- and harder on me because I&#39;m not being given room to take care of myself and recover.  There probably isn&#39;t a good time to get bc, but I&#39;m certainly having a much harder time be optimistic this go around.</Content>

		<Content>Diagnosed in October 2007.  I&#39;m 48.  Surgeon either wouldn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t tell me how long my cancer had been there.  She did say &amp;quot;quite some time.&amp;quot;  I have no family history.  I&#39;m convinced this disease is environmental and stress related. (Just my opinion)  I&#39;m going through chemo right now.  Should be finished just before my 49th birthday.</Content>

		<Content>I was, and am 46 yrs old and was diagnosed november 2007.  IDC 1.2 and 1.8 barbell shaped, and DCIS in same breast which is my left.  Mastectomy in late april or early may.  I have had no surgery yet, but am on #5 of 6 chemo treatments tomorrow. 
 I too thought I was too young for this.  Amazing how many of us are so young. I think it is due to early detection and the older ones not taking advantage of the computer.</Content>

 I went for the dreaded mammogram a day before my 31st birthday last Feb. Now, as my birthday approaches this year, I&#39;m getting rather anxious. One year anniversary coming up!

 BethNY: &amp;quot;Time flies, even when you&#39;re NOT having fun.&amp;quot; How true!  Not quite LOL, sort of smirking sardonically in agreement!
 LeahIA -- welcome!  I too had missed mammo for 3 years, but the lump I felt (which turned out to be IDC) never even showed up on mammo -- I was grateful to be spared extra incentive to kick myself...  please don&#39;t kick yourself, anyway!  (((hugs)))
 Evy178 -- is that your daughter holding her new baby brother?  Beautiful!  By the way, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any such thing as tmi on this board.  There&#39;s another new young poster here whose username is PregnantCancerGirl -- she too was dx&#39;d while pregnant.  My heart goes out to you both, and I&#39;m in awe of how strong you both have been.</Content>

		<Content>SMM, I was diagonosed on the exact same day, the Thursday before Christmas of 2007. Quite a day.  I am 41, a single mom with a six-year-old boy.
 My aunt had bc 14 years ago (lumpectomy and radiation; she is fine now) but I had the genetic test and it was negative for BRCA-1 and -2, so this may not be hereditary at all.</Content>

		<Content>I felt the lump under my arm 2 days after my 45th birthday in Nov. 2006, and knew right away it was a lymph node and I was in trouble. I decided to wait until after the holidays, which were especially difficult this year, as my dad had died on Thanksgiving the previous year from Bladder cancer. However, my best friend insisted I make an appt. with my doc. He felt the lumps, and the lymph nodes and sent me down for a mammogram and an ultrasound and scheduled me to see a surgeon the following day. I was actually dx on Dec. 22, 2006.</Content>

		<Content>I was dx&#39;d on 4/10/08, a month before my 48th b-day. I found the intial &amp;quot;suspicious mass&amp;quot; during a self-exam just before my cycle started in March.  I had never had a mammogram before because I wasn&#39;t high risk, no family history and never felt anything during  my monthly self-exams.  Turns out that my breast tissue is so dense &amp;quot;you can hide a mack truck in them&amp;quot; per my surgeon and my onco. After a FNA and core biopsies it turned out that there were actually 4 masses - 2 nodes and 2 tumors.  Had a left side mastectomy and axillary node removal 5/29/08  (18 nodes removed, 2 positive) and am currently on DD A/C and Taxol (just finished the A/C yesterday).</Content>

		<Content>I think I&#39;m the oldie. I&#39;m 78, will be 79 in October. Had a lupectomy on the 23 of July. Had 19 lymph nodes removed. I have HER2. Will have chemo, radiation, and Herception. Will wear a port for a year. It&#39;s a bummer, but the onc says I&#39;m otherwise healthy and I have a strong heart. Hugs to all, Dee</Content>
